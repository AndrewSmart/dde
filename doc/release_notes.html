<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.5.9, Oct 24, 2018</summary>
<ul>
    <li> User Guide debugging section: extended and slight re-organization.</li>

    <li> Fixed socket code bug by putting a space between arguments in instructions.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.5.8, Oct 23, 2018</summary>
Highlights: Calibration dialog extended. Bug fixes.
<ul>
    <li> Jobs menu/Calibrate Dexter isolated init_calibrate fn
    to make redefining it easier.</li>

    <li> Jobs Menu Calibrate Dexter dialog box extended.<br/>
         When you select a robot, it does "robot_cal_init".<br/>
         If there is only one robot defined when the user
         choose Jobs menu/calibrate dexter,
         automatically run robot_cal_init
         else, have the "default" robot that shows up in the select box be "choose robot",
         then all the defined robots are on that select menu below "choose robot",
         BUT make the top one be Dexter.last_robot<br/>
         robot_cal_init:<br/>
         pop up modal show_window dialog  (doesn't allow clicking outside of dialog)<br/>
         Says "Please wait while initializing Robot for calibration".<br/>
         Has button "Cancel".<br/>
         Normal operation is that it creates a job with a
         read_from_robot instruction,
         and when the job completes, the show_window is automatically closed.</li>

    <li> Fixed machine vision demos to load pictures with slight a delay,
         so their data is accessible by subsequent code.
         Reduced size of too-large show_windows.</li>

    <li> Fixed the ref man, serial robot, testsuite, unknown failure.
         Now all 1777 tests pass.</li>

Highlights: move instructions extentions include handling joints 6 & 7,
            NaN for "no change" and sending instructions to
            any robot.<br/>
            Documentation extensions include new Getting Started guide.<br/>
            TestSuite extensions include the automaitc starting of Jobs
            in tests with Job definitions.<br/>
            Run Instruction dialog extensions include support for J6 & J7.<br/>
            Robot Status dialog improvements.<br/>
            gcode improvements.
<ul>
    <li> Fixed 3 pieces of code in the RefMan that failed in running the
        ref man test suite.</li>

    <li>inspect: for "short info" of an object instance var val, increased
        the potential length for an array being displayed from 6 to 10.</li>

    <li> Bug fixed in Jobs menu/Run Instruction/Show Dialog for move cmds.</li>

    <li> Added
       <ul><li><code>Dexter.J6_ANGLE_MIN</code> => <samp> 0 </samp></li>
           <li><code>Dexter.J6_ANGLE_MAX</code> => <samp> 296 </samp></li>
           <li><code>Dexter.J7_ANGLE_MIN</code> => <samp> 0 </samp></li>
           <li><code>Dexter.J7_ANGLE_MAX</code> => <samp> 296 </samp></li>
        </ul>
        used only for Run Instruction dialog
    </li>

    <li> Run Instruction dialog added J6 and J7.

    <li> Run Instruction dialog: the number spinner controls constrain the value
        to be within the indicated range for the joint.
        But you can type in other values in the input if you like.
     </li>

    <li> Run Instruction dialog: move_all_joints and move_to values can now be blank
        signifying "no change" for that joint or x,y,z.
        A tooltip on the input inputs explains this.</li>

    <li> Run Instruction dialog now has a button in upper right named
        "Insert Dexter Def" that inserts new Dexter
        definition with its name and ip address.</li>

    <li> For move_all_joints and "a" oplet instructions,
        DDE converts the degrees given for J6 and J7 into
        the dynamixel units of 0.29 of a degree
        before sending that value to Dexter.</li>

    <li> robot.status for J6_MEASURED_ANGLE and J7_MEASURED_ANGLE
        are presumed to be in dynamixel units coming from Dexter.
        These are converted to degrees for DDE's use in robot_status.</li>

    <li><code>Job.prototype.gcode_to_instructions</code>
        got rid of file_content call
        with callback, which is no longer supported.</li>

    <li> <code>Job.gobj_to_move_to</code>
         extended to accept a line of gcode as a string.</li>

    <li> The parameters to <code>Dexter.run_gcode</code> have been changed.
        It used to take by_position arguments. Now it takes keyword arguments.
        The scale parameter has been replaced with workspace_pose so that it
        can perform scale, rotation and offset.
        A new argument is gcode, used to pass in a string of gcode that
        is prepended to the filepath arguments.
        See Ref Man/Robot/Dexter/Dexter Instructions/run_gcode
        for updated doc.</li>

    <li> <code>Socket.send</code> Fixed bug in getting the JOB_ID out of the instruction array,
        which prevented DDE from connecting to Dexter.</li>

    <li> <code>Socket.close</code> 2nd argument now defaults to null
        so that its default value
        uses the value of the simulate radio button in DDE.
        (This is obscure. Most users won't call this method directly.)</li>

    <li> <button>Eval</button> button behavior w.r.t. selection has been improved.
        When there's a selection in the cmd input, hitting ENTER will
        eval just that selected source.</li>

    <li> Doc: clarified the instructions to download DDE in the User Guide.</li>

    <li> Extended User Guide/Configure Dexter/Data Connection
        documentation about using an IP scanner to find and set a Dexter's IP address
        in DDE.</li>

    <li> Doc pane <b>Articles</b> moved down to below the Ref Man.</li>

    <li> At hdrobotic.com/software
        Now the documentation has twist-downs similar to the twist downs
        in DDE doc pane for easier browsing</li>

    <li> Doc: new <b>Getting Started</b> top level section in the Doc pane.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug in User Guide/Data Connection near "Go to Start/Control Panel"</li>

    <li> Simplified the Robot Status dialog to not let you choose a Job.
        You can now only select a robot.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug in Robot Status dialog whereby it did not automatically
        update the displayed data as the selected robot's job is running.</li>

    <li> Robot Status dialog now has a new button "run status job"
        which runs a job to get the robot status.</li>

    <li> Robot Status dialog now comes up even if no job has been run on
        that robot. The data for the robot displays as "no status",
        but you can click the new "run status job" button
        to get data from the robot.</li>


    <li> Fixed click help to scroll to doc for "Dexter.write_to_robot".</li>

    <li> Fixed click help to display name of function being clicked on
        when showing its source code.</li>

    <li>Minor improvements to User Guide/Why Use DDE? and Installation.</li>

    <li> Fixed Ref Man/Dexter.get_robot_status description.</li>

    <li> Slight improvement to formatting in User Guide/Help System.</li>

    <li> Clicking on a word in the cmd input now displays click help on it.</li>

    <li> Test menu new item: <i>Run TestSuite File</i>
        allows you to choose a file and run just the tests in that file.</li>

    <li> Added make_html_testsuite.js to run all TestSuites.</li>

    <li> Added move_all_joints_testsuite.js to run all TestSuites.</li>

    <li> <i>Run all TestSuites</i> now displays a summary of
           statistics at the end of its report.</li>

    <li>A test in a TestSuite can now contain source code for
        creating a Job. (i.e. <code>new Job({...})</code>.
        When such a test is run, the Job is defined then
        started. The Test suite is suspended until the
        job is completed, then the test site is resumed.
        This allows tests after the Job-defining test to
        verify values in the Job that were created while
        running the job.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug in read_from_robot in getting its "payload".</li>

    <li> Fixed bug in move_to_straight AND made it accept a robot subject
        so that it can move a different robot than the default one for the job.</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.make_ins</code> is a synonym for shortcut make_ins.
        This long cut is consistent with other dexter command and
        more explicit.</li>

    <li> <code>Robot.dexter0.make_ins</code>
         syntax now works to send the instruction to another
        Dexter instance.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug in the simulator for recording of angles
        for <code>Dexter.pid_move_all_joints</code> instructions.</li>

    <li> Standardized examples of calls to move_all_joints to always take its
        joint angles as an array.</li>

    <li> <code>dexter0.pid_move_all_joints(...)</code> now works.
        The joint angles passed can all be in an array.</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code>,<br/>
         <code>Dexter.pid_move_all_joints</code>,<br/>
         <code>Dexter.move_all_joints_relative</code><br/>
    instructions can take 5, 6 or 7 angles.
    Can take the angles passed in as one array or spread out as individual args.
    Can take NaN angles (keep the same)
    move_all_joints, pid_move_all_joints can take relative angles
    (surrounded by square brackets).
    if user specifies 5 or less items , send 5 to dexter.
    if user specifies 6, send 6,
    if user specifies 7, send 7.
    When the degree values for joints 6 and 7 are sent to Dexter,
    they are converted to Dynamixel units, each is worth 0.29 degrees.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Lots of new docmmentation in the Ref Man for the
             new features listed in DDE 2.5.0 release notes
             including all the Dexter.move* instructions
             and the new RobotStatus class.
             More doc needs to be done for RobotStatus, but
             this is a healthy start.
        <li>Updated version of build script to help make Mac release</li>
    </ul>

  <li>The underlying software package for speech recognition was
      interfering with building DDE releases so that
       underlying support has been removed for now.
       If you were depending on soeech reco, please use
       an eariler version of DDE, and let us know what

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.5.0, Aug 29, 2018</summary>
Highlights: Jobs may run instructions on more than one Dexter.<br/>
            Support for Joint 6 & Joint 7<br/>
            Reconfiguration of robot_status 1D array.<br/>
            New RobotStatus class<br/>
            move_to_straight extended, including a new "T" oplet for it.
<p></p>
<i><b>Lots of low-level software has changed in this release.
Mostly this is backwards-compatible but there might be a few
unusual cases where this is not the case.
<p></p>
This is a "test" release for Haddington internal testing purposes.
The extensions in this release will be more formally documented in a subsequent
release. For now, please make-do with the below.</b></i></li>
<ul>
    <li> Ref man entries for load_files and file_content now point at each other.</li>

    <li>Undid first item in 2.4.6 release notes, regarding Sockets because
        it caused bugs.</li>

    <li>A job may now contain instructions for more than one Dexter.
        The "move" instructions can take a subject of an instance of a Dexter,<br/>
        i.e. <code>Robot.dexter0.move_all_joints([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])</code><br/>
        These instructions don't incur an extra item added to the do_list like
        they use to so they will be faster.</li>


    <li> Most places you use an array or list of joints now take
         7 joint angles instead of 5.<br/>
         The "move_to" instructions also take new args for J6 and J7.<br/>
         J6 is generally the "twist" of the end effector, and<br/>
         J7 is generally the gripper motor degrees for opening
           and closing a gripper.</li>

    <li> <code>move_all_joints, pid_move_all_joints, move_all_joints_relative</code>
        have their
        params named: <code>array_of_5_angles</code> renamed to <code>array_of_angles</code></li>


    <li> Dexter.robot_status_labels  updated:
<pre><code>Depricated:
Dexter.DMA_READ_DATA    = 6
Dexter.READ_BLOCK_COUNT = 7

Dexter.J1_PLAYBACK = 16
Dexter.J1_SLOPE    = 18

Dexter.J2_PLAYBACK = 26
Dexter.J2_SLOPE    = 28

Dexter.J3_PLAYBACK = 36
Dexter.J3_SLOPE    = 38

Dexter.J4_PLAYBACK = 46
Dexter.J4_SLOPE    = 48

Dexter.J5_PLAYBACK = 56
Dexter.J5_SLOPE    = 58
</code></pre>
</li>

    <li><code>Dexter.J1_FORCE_CALC_ANGLE</code> and on up to <code>J5_FORCE_CALC_ANGLE</code>
         have been deprecated.
         Now these values are set to the same index of the new
         <code>Dexter.J1_MEASURED_ANGLE</code> (and friends)
         so that asking for the value of the robot_status 1D array at <code>Dexter.J1_FORCE_CALC_ANGLE</code>
         will now get the value at <code>Dexter.J1_MEASURED_ANGLE</code></li>

    <li>New fields in the 1D robot_status array:
        <ul><li><code>Dexter.J6_MEASURED_ANGLE</code>
            <li><code>Dexter.J7_MEASURED_ANGLE</code>
            <li><code>Dexter.J6_MEASURED_TORQUE</code>
            <li><code>Dexter.J7_MEASURED_TORQUE</code>
            <li><code>Dexter.JOB_ID_OF_CURRENT_INSTRUCTION</code>
            <li><code>Dexter.CURRENT_INSTRUCTION_ID</code>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Socket.instruction_array_degrees_to_arcseconds_maybe can now take
        "a" and "P" instructions with any number of angle args.</li>

    <li><code>make-ins("a" ...)</code> calls now take any number of joint angle args.</li>

    <li> <code>make_ins</code> new optional last arg of a robot_instance,
        where the instruction is sent. If no such last arg exists,
        the instrution will be sent to the "default" robot defined
        in the Job instance.</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.pid_move_all_angles</code> & <code>Dexter.pid_move_to</code> now consistently
        get default angles from and set robot.pid_angles.</li>

    <li> <code>move_all_joints</code>, <code>pid_move_all_joints</code>,
         <code>move_to</code>, <code>pid_move_to</code>, <code>move_to_straight</code>,
        All default unpassed values for joint angles (or x, y, z) to their
        previous values.</li>

    <li> If a passed in degree  (or x,y,z) value for a "move" command is
        wrapped in an array,
        then the first value of that array is considered to be "relative"
        and is added to the existing value to come up with the new value.<br/>
        Example: <br/>
        <code>Robot.dexter0.move_all_joints([1, [2.5], 3, [4.5], 5, 6, 7])</code>
        Above the values of 2.5 and 4.5 are <i>relative</i> to the previously
        commanded degrees for joints 2 and 4.</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.HOME_ANGLES</code> <code>NEUTRAL_ANGLES</code>, <code>PARKED_ANGLES</code>
        all are now of length 7 with two zeros on the end.</li>

    <li>New Oplet "T" for the Dexter-side version of <code>Dexter.move_to_straight</code>.
        Example:<br/>
        <pre><code>make_ins("T",
            x, y, z,
            J5_direction[0], J5_direction[1], J5_direction[2],
            config[0], config[1], config[2],
            tool_speed, resolution,
            j6_angle, j7_angle)</code></pre>
            with an optional robot_instance as an additional last arg.
    </li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.move_to_straight</code> instruction has been extended
         with a new param: <code>single_instruction</code>.
         Default false. But if true,
        a <code>make_ins("T" ...)</code> instruction is generated and sent to Dexter
        instead of a long array of other low level instructions.
    </li>

    <li>To support the new "T" instruction, the Socket code now converts
         tool_speed and resolution args from "meters" to "microns",
         ie they are multiplied by 1,000,000</li>

    <li> move_to_straight's generated make_ins instructions now take
         a last array elt of the robot instance.</li>

    <li> Bug fix: <code>Dexter.move_to_relative</code>  changed
       from using <code>job_instance.robot.pose</code>
        to
       <code>this.workspace_pose</code></li>


    <li> <code>Dexter.move_to_straight</code> now takes a new <code>workspace_pose</code> arg.</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.move_to_straight</code> now takes keyword args.
      This is an incompatible change.
       An explicit error message is displayed when you call move_to_straight with
       by_position args.</li>

    <li> Bugs fixed in <code>Dexter.move_to_relative</code> with the workspace_pose.
        It had some params misspelled of "workspace_pos".</li>

    <li> <code>robot.pid_angles</code> used more consistently for the pid instructions.</li>


    <li> <code>robot.angles</code> and <code>robot.pid_angles</code> now inited to
        <code>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]</code>
         (was <code>[0,0,0,0,0]</code> ).</li>

    <li>Updated Dexter simulator to the new 7 angles, etc. Fixes to
         compution duration.</li>

    <li>The "Show Robot Status" dialog box has been updated to the new
        robot_status fields.</li>

    <li><code>RobotStatus</code> class provides high level access to the robot_status array.</li>
</ul>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.4.6, Aug 3, 2018</summary>
Highlghts: Jobs gracefully finish under some conditions of the
socket connection between DDE and Dexter failing.
<ul>
    <li> If the socket connection between DDE and Dexter is broken after
    DDE has sent an instruction but before that instruction's reception is acknowledged
    from Dexter to DDE, then DDE will stop the job formally.
    DDE waits 200ms after sending the instruction to declare that the
    socket connection is broken.
    </li>


    <li> Picture.make_classifier doc extended to say that you can't use a url for the path argument,
    it must be a local file.
    The doc also explains that the default xml works poorly with faces with glasses on.
    </li>

    <li> Picture.classifier_detect doc updated to explain the example.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.4.5, July 31, 2018</summary>
<ul>
<li> Fixed bug in display of Evaled source code in the Output pane header.
This bug was also responsible for breaking the Insert menu/Machine Vision/ demos,
and probably a bunch of other things, especially when evaling a large
amount of source code (that would likely include single quotes).
</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.4.4, July 27, 2018</summary>
Highlights: Serial port robot improved greatly.<br/>
            new OpenCV classifier interface for detecting objects in images.<br/>
            Click help for built-in JS constructs improved.<br/>
            Eval&Start button can run a robot instruction.<br/>
            patch_until helps manage software patches.<br/>
            Improvements to the Vector library.<br/>
<ul>
    <li> Removed console printouts when evaling a Job,
        related to: inspect_set_new_object_onclick,
        Inspect_next_value_id and not Inspect_prev_value_id
        as their not indicating something that's wrong.</li>

    <li> Removed undocumented & unused utility function dom_child_elts_of_class
         Use  <code>dom_elt_children_of_class(elt, a_class)</code> instead.
        Note that dom_elt_children_of_class does not take a return_first_or_null,
        it always returns an array (which might be empty).</li>

    <li> When printing out a result of an eval in the output pane,
        the source is now shown. Note that you can select the source
        or a portion of it, then click the Eval button to eval it again.
        If the source is long, only its first line, and maximally only 55 chars
        is shown (with ... indicated it has been truncated).
        But hovering over it gives a tooltip of the full source.</li>

    <li> Bug fix for the run instruction dialog when you attempt to start
        running a new instruction before the previous one has completed.</li>

    <li> Extended the documentation for <code>Picture.show_video</code> for the content and camera_id
        parameters.</li>

    <li>The serial port Job example, simulate flag on the robot definition
        has been changed from <code>false</code> to <code>null</code>
        so that it pays attention to the Jobs menu/Simulate? flag.</li>

    <li><code>new Serial()</code> can now take a simulate arg that is null,
        so that the actual simulate comes from the Jobs menu/Simulate? submenu.
        null is the new default.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug that had the Instruction class for string_instruction
        erroneously named "suspend".</li>

    <li><code>Serial.string_instruction</code> and <code>Robot.grab_robot_status</code> have been extended
        to accept a robot instance in place of <code>Serial</code> and <code>Robot</code>
        respectively,
        to direct the instruction to a particular robot regardless of the
        default robot declared in the job.
        Ref Man/Robot/Serial and
        Ref Man/Robot/Robot Instructions/grab_robot_status
        have been improved and extended to describe these
        new capabilities.
        See especially the new section: Ref Man/Robot/Serial/Multiple Serial Ports</li>

    <li>New Series: JavaScript Object Names.</li>

    <li>New method: <code>Picture.make_classifier</code>.
        Use an xml file to create a classifier.</li>

    <li>New method: <code>Picture.classifier_detect</code>. Use a classifier to
        identify objects in a picture. Especially good for face detection.</li>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.4.3, July 18, 2018</summary>
Highlights: New methods: Picture.detect_blobs, Picture.similarity_by_detect_blobs.
Arrow keys in editor behave more conventionally. Sim pane more useful.
<ul>
    <li> Sim Pane menu "Dexter Photo" now expands the photo as the user expands the pane.
    "Reference Manual" displays the ref man in the sim pane.
    "Choose File" allows you to choose and image file, HTML file
    or various text files to display.</li>

    <li> Insert menu/Machine Vision/Locate Object code cleaned up to
    remove lint formatting warnings. Picture declared as a known value.</li>

    <li> Insert menu/Machine Vision/Locate Object demo slightly improved.</li>

    <li> New method: <code>Picture.detect_blobs</code>
        See Ref Man/IO/Picture/High Level/detect_blobs</li>

    <li> New method: <code>Picture.similarity_by_detect_blobs</code>
        See Ref Man/IO/Picture/Similarity/similarity_by_detect_blobs</li>

    <li> New Insert menu/Machine Vision/Picture Similarity  demo</li>

    <li> All Picture.similarity methods now take keyword, instead of by-position args.</li>

    <li> <code>Picture.show_picture</code> dialog box now has a more informative title when
        displaying a mat, giving its type and size.</li>

    <li> Choosing Insert menu/Machine Vision/Locate Object and
        Insert menu/Machine Vision/Picture Similarity
        scrolls the doc to the appropriate method.</li>

    <li> Robot status dialog box fixed for displaying non-numbers.</li>

    <li> In the previous releases, using the arrows keys in the editor
    navigated TestSuites and Series. This conflicted with more
    conventional uses of the arrow keys for text editing operations.
    In this release, DDE's special uses of arrow keys have been switched
    to Alt- arrow key, and the conventional use of the arrow keys
    is now available.
    Test menu/Navigation and User Guide/TestSuite have been
    updated accordingly.</li>

    <li> Joint limits: Now the Dexter instructions:
       <ul><li><code>move_to</code></li>
           <li><code>pid_move_to</code></li>
           <li><code>move_all_joints</code></li>
           <li><code>pid_move_all_joints</code></li>
       </ul>
       do not error when they are passed angles that exceed the joint limits.</li>

    <li> <code>show_window</code> new parameter: resizable.
        Previously, show_windows were unresizable.
        Now you can set resizable to true (the default)
        such that existing calls to show_window are now all resizable
        by the user.
        See Doc Ref Man/Window System/show_window/resizable.</li>

    <li> Series menu/DDE/Robot/Robot subclass now inserts
    <code title="not in test suite.">new Dexter({name: "my_dex", ip_address: "192.168.1.142", simulate: null})</code>
    (added ip_address and simulate args)</li>

    <li> Jobs bar buttons now scroll horizontally if there are
        too many of them to fit in the Output pane header.
        You can still drag DDE's vertical splitter bar to the right
        to show more job buttons at a time.</li>

    <li> Fixed <code>number_similarity</code> bug for a neg and a pos number.</li>

    <li> DDE menu bar menus: now you have to click to pull them down.
         Hovering no longer does it.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.4.1, July 7, 2018</summary>
<ul>
 <li> fixed typo in test_suites.js</li>

 <li> fixed typo in Picture1.js</li>

 <li> update pkg.json webmidi version number from  "^2.0.0-rc.7", to "^2.0.0"
    to fix octave problems in testsuite.</li>

 <li> Fixed test suite tests for Vector library poses.</li>

  <li> improved Sim pane doc slightly. (click on "Sim" in the Sim pane header.)</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.4.0, July 6, 2018</summary>
Highlights: new Picture class for machine vision. Bug fix for Vector.rotate.
<ul>
<li>Improved face reco demo to not depend on Internet connection.</li>

<li><code>string_to_literal</code> now places backquote around strings with embedded
newlines. Fixes bug in selection to test for tests returning multi-lined
results.</li>

<li>Updated numerous packages that DDE uses to their latest version
(with the same MAJOR version).<br/>
This caused an incompatibility with webmidi.
Previously, Middle C (midi pitch 60) was in octave 3.
Now it is octave 4.<br/>
    <code>WebMidi.guessNoteNumber("C4")</code> => <samp>60</samp>
This is more standard amongst musicians
that actually know what an octave is, and thus better.
Lacking still is the mistake by MIDI designers of
making Middle C being pitch number 60 instead of 48
(because 4 * 12 = 48, not 60),
but most standards have these kinds of illogic in them.</li>

<li><code>close_window</code>  Extended functionality:
If no argument is passed, the latest <code>show_window</code> is closed.
if there is no existing window specified by the argument, a warning
is printed but does not error.
See Ref Man/Window System/Window Utilities/close_window.</li>

<li> Ref Man/Robot/Dexter Instructions/move_to improved.</li>

<li> Bug in <code>Vector.rotate()</code> fixed.</li>

<li> <code>Picture</code> is a new class that's a high level wrapper for
some simpler, more common OpenCV.js use cases.
There are 34 new methods and a LOT of doc (with example calls) in<br/>
Ref Man/IO/Picture<br/>
New menu item: Insert Menu/Machine Vision/Locate Object.<br/>
Still a work in progress.</li>

<li>Inspector specializes OpenCV "mat" instances to make inspecting and viewing them easier.
  When inspecting a "mat", a "show_picture" button is displayed.
  Clicking on the button shows you the image.
  If you click on a pixel in the image, you see its
  x, y, red, green, blue values displayed in the Output pane.</li>

</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.3.18, June 12, 2018</summary>

<li> Blob Detector Demo:<br/>
fixed bug in initial loading with the "image" not being ready to be processed.<br/>
fixed spelling in documentation<br/>
fixed the two columns from jumping around because they were vertically "centered".
now their tops are always at the top of the window.
</li>

<li> EZTeach A bug has been fixed.</li>

<li> <code>kin.move_to_straight</code>
   had an erroneous fourth arg that previously did not do anything.
However a fourth arg was added to kin.xyz_to_jangles which caused it to error.
This fourth arg has been removed.
This bug is not expected to come up anywhere else.</li>

<li> Made <i>Show robot status</i> more robust in the face of potentially
unexpected non-numerical inputs to the table. (changed calls to toFixed)</li>


<li><code>Dexter.dummy_move</code>, bug fixed that prevented
   Dexter.dummy_move from working if
your job's robot wasn't named "my_dex".
From James W. It looks like Dexter.dummy_move() is broken on the DDE side.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.3.15, May 11, 2018</summary>
    Highlights: numerous bug fixes, minor other improvements.

    <li> Dexter.write_to_robot changed max_content_chars from 252 to 244.</li>

    <li> A job's button tooltip tells you the instruction number
        (Job Program Counter) that its currently at.</li>

    <li> When a job reaches a wait_until instruction the job's button tooltip is
        more explicit.</li>

    <li> Robot.wait_until, fixed bug when you pass a Duration instance
    as wait_until's argument.</li>

    <li> Doc for Ref Man/Robots/Dexter/new Dexter parameters extended
        with an example of:
        new Dexter({name: "my_dex",
        simulate: true,
        ip_address: "192.186.1.142",
        port: 50000 //the default
        })</li>

    <li> Robot.wait_until instruction now can take a Job as an instance.
         The job containing the wait_until instruction waits until
         the passed in Job completes (or errors).</li>

    <li> Extend Robot.start_job to take another arg: wait_until_job_done (default false)
        if true, the job containing the Robot.start_job instruction pauses until
        the designated job is finished.
        Now we can make a sequence of jobs in another job,
        a la
        new Job({do_list: [ Robot.start_job("a"), Robot.start_job("b")}
        and have b be started after a is done.</li>

    <li> Expanded doc in Ref Man/Job/new Job paramaters/do_list</li>

    <li> New instruction: Dexter.write_to_robot writes a file to Dexter.
        See Ref Man/Robot/Dexter/Dexter Instructions/write_to_robot
        example file arg:
        "/srv/samba/share/AdcCenters.txt"
        but in the ViewEyeRealTime.js its
        path =  "//" + ip_address + "/share/AdcCenters.txt"</li>

    <li> User Guide "Debugging" section extended with "Click on Delimiter"
         and a bit of reorganizing for easier access.</li>

         of the launch process.</li>

    <li>Job.start sets "starting" status earlier and colors job button accordingly
       job button is now a pale green during "starting".</li>

    <li> fixed bug in EasyTeach with workspace pose.</li>

    <li> While running a job, if there is an error in a user defined function
    (and some other possible errors) they are now caught and
    the job terminates properly turning the job button red
    and showing an error message in the tooltip relating to the cause.</li>

    <li> improved formatting of sync point job example.</li>

Highlights: Fix for Dexter's "jitters" and 6 other bug fixes.
<ul>
    <li>In Dexter's modes, pidBase changed to prevent oscillations.</li>

    <li>Robot.start: at beginning of a job, if a 'ping' to Dexter
    is successful, wait 500ms before sending instructions to give
    Dexter initialization a chance to complete.</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.set_parameter("MaxSpeed", 0)</code> (or less)  causes an error.
        (but not in low level make_ins calls)</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.set_parameter("MaxSpeed", 0.0000001)</code> warns:
        Dexter.set_parameter called with MaxSpeed of: 0.0000001
        which is too low.
        MaxSpeed set to the minimum permissible speed of:
        0.00012895346330171073</li>

    <li> <code>Dexter.set_parameter("StartSpeed", -1)</code> now errors immediately.

 Extra Units series help
<ul>
    <li> <code>make_dom_elt</code> is now documented.
        It and <code>make_html</code> are now in the 'window' series.</li>

    <li>Now, before instructions are sent to a Dexter,
        it is pinged. If it responds, the instructions are sent.
        If not, the job errors with an instructive error message.</li>

    <li> Now when you choose Series menu/Units System/any item
        besides Help and temperature,
        in addition to the usual insertion of the first series item
        and a line in the output pane about it,
        a <i>second</i> line in the output pane lists all the units in the
        series you've selected.
        The tooltip on each item gives you details about it.
        Clicking the item itself inserts the
        item in the editor, preceded by "*".
        This is an experimental feature.</li>

         "on" html properties (about 80 of them)</li>

    <li> html_db fixed omission in html properties. Now allows "data-*" props.</li>

    <li> Minor fixes to Object system doc.</li>

    <li> Extended User Guide/UI Design Criteria.</li>

    <li> <code>Job.inter_do_item_dur</code> had a mistake in the documentation.
        It said this was in milliseconds, but its actually seconds.
        There was another error in recording the default value
        that might have affected something else.
        Both fixed.</li>

    <li>Better formatting for data output from exTeach to make it much
        more human readable.</li>

    <li><code>newObject.callPrototypeConstructor</code> fixed infinite recursion bug.</li>

    <li>Extended Ref Man/IO/Sound/Music With Midi/Connecting Midi Apps/

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.3.5, Jan 19, 2018</summary>
Highlights: Bug fixes and a few internal mods.
<ul>
    <li> Improvements to Ref Man/Robot/Robot Instructions/Any Start Object</li>

    <li> Extended the Insert Menu/show_window/svg menu item label
         with the suffix "(2D drawing)" just in case uses don't know
         what svg means.</li>

    <li> show robot_status dialog now prints the bulk of the numbers
        as having exactly 3 digits to the right of the decimal point
        and right-justifies the number so that the decimal points
        of the cells in a column will line up.
        This should also reduce the dynamic changing of the width of
        a column as a robot is moving.
        May still need improvement. Feedback welcome.</li>

    <li> Bug fix to the Kinematics "vector.add" bug.
         Removed "known issue" about this bug.

Highlights: Windows 10 OneDrive bug fix
<ul><li> Improved User Guide doc on the Eval button.</li>

    <li> Another attempt to fix Windows 10 OneDrive bug.</li>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.3.1, Jan 15, 2018</summary>
Highlights: Fixes for Calibrate and maybe Windows "OneDrive" bug.
<ul>
    <li> Fix for calibrate "merge" problem of ViewEyeRealTime.js </li>

    <li>Maybe fix, (needs testing) bug on windows with OneDrive
        and defining <code>dde_apps_dir</code>.</li>


    <li> New example for <code>show_window</code> that uses <code>make_html</code>
       In Ref man/Window System/show_window.</li>

    <li> Explanation in the special error message for <code>shouldnt</code> calls.</li>

    <li> Now, when there is a selection in
        both editor and non-editor, the <button>Eval</button> button,
        uses the non-editor selection
        as that was made most recently.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.3.0, Jan 15, 2018</summary>
Highlights: Robot.loop instruction, make_html function, Step button,
            Calibration improvements
<ul>
    <li> Minor improvement in testSuite reporting for bad "expected source".</li>

    <li> Running all tests now warns you to expect 2 unknown and 1 known
         error in the first test suite.</li>

    <li> <code>to_source_code</code> for <code>Note</code> and <code>Phrase</code> now implemented and in test suite,
         fixing the test suite errors they had caused.</li>

    <li> Bug fix to <code>to_source_code({value: a_fn})</code></li>

    <li> Improved tooltip on the Command Line.</li>

    <li> new instruction: <code>Robot.loop</code> See Ref Man/Robot/Robot.instructions/loop</li>

    <li> new instruction: <code>Robot.break</code> for use with Robot.loop. See Ref Man/Robot/Robot.instructions/break</li>

    <li> New menu item: Job menu/Insert Example/Robot.loop
        Choosing this example inserts 6 loop example jobs AND
        scrolls to the Robot.loop documentation in the Ref Man.</li>

    <li> The instruction <code>"debugger"</code> has been replaced with <code>Robot.debugger()</code>
        This makes DDE API more consistent with itself, and makes the
        implementation more modular.
        This is an incompatible change, but since "debugger" instructions
        are necessarily temporary, this won't affect perminent Job definitions.
        See Ref Man/Robot/Robot Instructions/debugger</li>

    <li> New <button>Step</button> button in Output pane to left of <button>Eval</button> button.
        Just like Eval button, but steps through the selected code instead.
        Reduces need to insert <code>debugger;</code> in your code AND
        need to set breakpoints in Chrome Dev Tools.<br/>
        Opens Chrome Dev Tools automatically<br/>
        See new doc in User Guide/Debugging/Stepping</li>


    <li> New doc: Ref Man/Robot/Dexter/Dexter instructions/move_all_joints/Dexter Positive Joint Direction    Diagrams.</li>

    <li> Extended calibration with better error message when the view eye goes in the working direction.</li>

    <li> New Doc section: User Guide/Calibrate Dexter/Calibrate Optical Sensors/Troubleshooting</li>

    <li> Fixed calibration dialog box to be able to take advantage of selecting
          which Dexter you're calibrating.</li>

    <li> Updated opencv.js to the latest version.</li>

    <li> New function: <code>make_html</code><br/>
        Advantages:
     <ol><li>Just js syntax. You don't have to know HTML & CSS punctuation.</li>
         <li>Easier to embedded computed values into the HTML. (better than string concat)</li>
         <li>Don't have to remember what's an html attribute and what's a style.</li>
         <li>Error checking for html tags, attribute names and style names which
             browsers don't do.</li>
    </ol>
    See Ref Man/Window System/make_html</li>

    <li> 3 new series': html_tags, html_property, css_property.
        New item on Series menu: HTML that has a submenu of all 3.
        Click help on each item has extensive links to doc for each.</li>

    <li> Improved Output pane printing of literal strings by removing
        backslash in some cases.</li>

    <li> Removed the undocumented utility fn <code>own_properties</code> because its behavior is
        the same as standard JS <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(an_object)</code>
        This is an incompatibility, but a slight one. Any users that
        happened to use own_properties will get an error as soon as its called,
        and can find the standard JS fn Object.getOwnPropertyNames.
        own_properties was not used within DDE before this so
        its need is probably quite uncommon.</li>

    <li> New utility function: <code>intersection</code>.</li>

    <li> Added "inspect" to known function for syntax linting.</li>

    <li> Improved User Guide/Configure Dexter/Data Connection for MacOS.</li>
</ul>

    <li> updated Insert menu/Machine Vision/Blob Detector to
        use init_elt_id, improved formatting.</li>

    <li> Human.enter_number now displays the min and max values automatically.</li>

    <li> Human.enter_number If you type in an out of range number, it
         tells you and let's you fix it.</li>

    <li> New User Guide Section: User Interface/UI Design Criteria.</li>

    <li> new instruction:
        Human.speak("some text") that says the text before moving on to the next
        instruction. See RefMan/Robot/Human/Human Instructions/speak.</li>

    <li> Though there have been some significant extensions to
         speech_recognition in this release, it is not now working.</li>

</ul>

    <li> [ ].micron()
        Returns a new array.
        All numbers in the input array are assumed to be in microns.
        Those numbers are converted to meters in the output array
        by dividing them by 1 million.</li>

    <li> [ ].arcsec()
        make_ins("a", 36000, 36000, 36000, 36000, 36000).arcsec()
        make_ins("P", 36000, 36000, 36000, 36000, 36000).arcsec()
        If the array is an instruction array with an oplet of "a" or "P" then
        convert its 5 angles to degrees
        else convert all numbers to degrees.
        Returns a new array, does not modify the input array.</li>

    <li> New function Kin.xyz_to_J_angles_v1() args in v1 format, return value in v1 format
        very similar to Kin.xyz_to_J_angles except that

        Dexter.LINK3_v1 = Dexter.LINK3 * 1000000 //in microns<br/>
        Dexter.LINK4_v1 = Dexter.LINK4 * 1000000 //in microns<br/>
        Dexter.LINK5_v1 = Dexter.LINK5 * 1000000 //in microns<br/></li>

    <li> Convert v1 to v2 extended in new doc:<br/>
        "Convert v1 to v2 in DDE 2.2.2"
        This is now a top level, "special" release notes doc.</li>

</ul>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Convert V.1 to V.2 in DDE 2.2.2</summary>
DDE Jobs written in DDE version 1 will likely break in DDE version 2 because
we have changed the default units for:
<ul><li><b>angles</b> from arcseconds to degrees.<br/>
    There are 3600 arcseconds in 1 degree.<br/>
    Affects instructions:<br/>
    <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code>,<br/>
    <code>Dexter.move_all_joints_relative</code>, <br/>
    <code>make_ins("a" ...)</code><br/>
    <code>make_ins("P" ...)</code><br/>
    The <code>Dexter.set_parameter</code> names that contain <code>Boundry</code>
    have changed from referring to arcseconds to referring to degrees.</li>
    <li><b>lengths</b> from microns to meters.<br/>
        There are 1 million microns in a meter.<br/>
        Affects instructions:<br/>
        <code>Dexter.move_to</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.move_to_relative</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.LINK1</code> thru <code>Dexter.LINK5</code></li>
    <li><b>durations</b> from milliseconds to seconds <br/>
        There are 1 thousand milliseconds in a second.<br/>
        Affects<br/>
         <code>Robot.wait_until</code> when passed a number,<br/>
        <code>Dexter.sleep</code> instruction<br/>
        Job's <code>inter_do_item_dur</code> parameter,<br/>
        all of which now expect durations in seconds.<br/>
        Note that inter_do_item_dur's default has also changed from 100 milliseocnds
        to 10 milliseconds, (now represented as 0.01 seconds)
         which should increase job running speed slightly. <br/>
        The <code>Dexter.set_parameter</code> names of <code>MaxSpeed</code>, <code>StartSpeed</code>,
        <code>Acceleration</code> have also changed into now being "seconds" based.
    </li>
</ul>
To convert your Jobs to the new units, search for each of the names
in white above and adjust their arguments accordingly. If you want
to preserve the actual numbers, you can leave them in place but
enter a "conversion suffix" after them using our new Ref Man documented
<a href="#" onclick="open_doc(units_system_help_doc_id)">Units System</a>
<p></p>
    <b>A Step by Step Conversion Process</b><br/>
    DDE code  from v1 to v2:
    <ul><li>Search for all "move_all_joints(" and "move_all_joints_relative"<br/>
            Add suffix to first arg like so:<br/>
             Dexter.move_all_joints([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].arcsec())<br/>
             arcsec() makes a copy of the array with the arcseconds
             converted to degrees.
             Note for calls like<br/>
            move_all_joints(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) it's easiest to change them to:
        move_all_joints([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].arcsec())
             </li>
        <li>When the code is READING values out of robot_inst.robot_status
            (user code shuld never write robot_status)
            most of the values will be angles that must be converted from degrees
            into arcseconds. These are
            <pre>
            "J1_ANGLE",            // BASE_POSITION_AT           10
            "J1_DELTA",            // BASE_POSITION_DELTA        11
            "J1_PID_DELTA",        // BASE_POSITION_PID_DELTA    12
            "J1_FORCE_CALC_ANGLE",            // BASE_POSITION_FORCE_DELTA  13
            "J1_MEASURED_ANGLE",   // actual angle from Dexter   19
            for all 5 joints.
            </pre>
            a la robot_inst.robot_status[Dexter.J1_ANGLE]*_arcsec or
            [robot_inst.robot_status[Dexter.J1_ANGLE],
             robot_inst.robot_status[Dexter.J2_ANGLE],
             robot_inst.robot_status[Dexter.J3_ANGLE],
             robot_inst.robot_status[Dexter.J4_ANGLE],
             robot_inst.robot_status[Dexter.J5_ANGLE]
             ].arcsec()
            </li>

        <li>Add to make_ins("a" ...) a suffix like so:<br/>
            make_ins("a" ...).arcsec()</li>

        <li>Add to make_ins("P" ...) a suffix like so:<br/>
            make_ins("P" ...).arcsec()</li>

        <li>Search for all "move_to(" and "move_to_relative("<br/>
            Add suffix to first arg like so:<br/>
             Dexter.move_to([1, 2, 3].micron() ...)<br/>
             micron makes a copy of the array with all numbers
             converted from microns to meters.
        </li>

        <li>Replace Kin.xyz_to_J_angles with Kin.xyz_to_J_angles_v1</li>

        <li>Replace Kin.J_angles_to_xyz() with Kin.J_angles_to_xyz_v1()</li>

        <li>Convert Dexter.LINK1 to Dexter.LINK1_v1.<br/>
            Same for  LINK's 2 through 5.</li>

        <li>Convert calls like:<br/>
            Robot.wait_until(1234) to <br/>
            Robot.wait_until(1234*_ms) or <br/>
            Robot.wait_until(1.234)
            Note that wait_until takes several OTHER types for its
            input arg that shouldn't be changed, but if
            it has as number, that number should be in seconds.
            </li>
        <li>Convert calls Dexter.sleep smilarly to wait_until
            except that sleep <i>only</i> take a number
            of seconds as its one required arg.</li>
        <li>In calls to <code>Dexter.set_parameter</code>,
           when its first arg is <code>"MaxSpeed"</code>, <code>"StartSpeed"</code> or
            <code>"Acceleration"</code>, add a suffix to the second arg like so:<br/>
            Dexter.set_parameter("MaxSpeed", 30000 / _nbits_cf)<br/>
            or the third arg in:<br/>
            make_ins("S", "MaxSpeed", 30000 / _nbits_cf)
        </li>
        <li>
            In calls to <code>Dexter.set_parameter</code>,
            when its first arg is <code>"J1BoundryHigh"</code>, <code>"J1BoundryLow"</code>
            change the call to be:<br/>
            Dexter.set_parameter("J1BoundryHigh", 648000*_arcsec) or<br/>
            make_ins("S", "J1BoundryHigh", 648000*_arcsec)
        </li>
        <li>Calls to Kin.angles_to_direction are now unnecessary.
           <pre>
            Change:
            J5_dir = Kin.angles_to_direction(GripperPossition[2], GripperPossition[3])
            movCMD.push(Dexter.move_to(oldPoint.micron(), J5_dir))
            To:
            J5_dir = [GripperPossition[2], GripperPossition[3]]
            movCMD.push(Dexter.move_to(oldPoint.micron(), J5_dir))
           </pre>
        <li>Change calls to making a new Job that use parameter <code>inter_do_item_dur</code>
            like so:<br/>
            new Job({inter_do_item_dur*_ms} ...)</li>
    </ul>
    This process is only for code that originally ran in DDE 1.
    Mixing DDE 1 and DDE 2 code is much more complex.<br/>
    Numbers to be converted must be converted exactly once.
    Converting a number more than once will cause a bug.
    Sticking to the above process helps convert numbers exactly once,
    but code can be complex so this process is not a guarantee of success.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.1.13, Oct 31, 2017</summary>
Highlights: No code or doc changes. Just made this release to
overcome release packaging issues.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.1.12, Oct 31, 2017</summary>
Highlights: Fixed backwards go_to bug. dde_version_between, to_source_code
<ul>
    <li> <code>verify_dde_version_between</code> renamed to <code>dde_version_between</code>,<br/>
         changed 3rd parameter to "action" that can take values "error", "warn", "boolean".<br/>
         Fixed bug.<br/>
         See Ref Man/Operating System, etc/dde_version_between.</li>

    <li> Jobs that are defined but not yet started now have their user_data property inited
            to the user_data value in the new constructor, just in case
            we want to call to_source_code on unstarted jobs.</li>

    <li> to_source_code for Jobs: indenting improved.</li>

    <li> Utility fn last now returns undefined instead of null when passed a zero lengthed item.
        If passed an unhandled type of arg, it now errors.</li>

    <li> to_source_code on a Job that has been run and NOT using orig_do_list prints out
        the trailing instruction of make_ins(3, 3, 1509036422423, "g")
        but beware that printing jobs that have been run, with orig_do_list=false
        will print both a move_all_joints and a make_inst("a")
        for a job with just 1 do_list item of move_all_joints in its def.</li>

    <li> new to_source_code methods for: Robot.grab_robot_status, Human.task, Human.enter_choice</li>

    <li> Robot.grab_robot_status instruction now has a default for the
         first arg (user data var) of "grabbed_robot_status".</li>

    <li> bug fixed in inserting instructions into do list that was not properly updating
        the hierarchical added_items_count array.
        This caused some instructions to be skipped when a <code>Robot.go_to</code>
        backwards instruction was executed.</li>
</ul>

Highlights: socket timeout bug fix. FindHome, ezTeach
<ul><li>dde_version_between documentation: Added an example call and return value
        to the Ref Man doc.</li>

    <li>Improvements to <code>to_source_code</code> including commas between elements
        in Jobs and literal objects.</li>

    <li>Changed default_default_dexter_port from a string "50000" to an integer: 50000</li>

    <li>Auto-re-init for Dexter socket that has timed out.
        This tries several times to connect at increasing durations between tries.
        If it can't connect after 4 tries lasting up to a second, the
        job errors.</li>

    <li>ezTeach now available from the Insert menu/ezTeach
        which scrolls to the new User Guide section: "ezTeach".</li>

    <li>FindHome is a new button on the Calibrate dialog box.
        It is also a new top level section in the User Guide.
        Clicking on its button  in the Calibrate dialog
        defines the FindHome job and scrolls
        the doc pane to the FindHome section.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.1.9, Oct 25, 2017</summary>
Highlights: to_source_code implemented but not complete.
            dde version checking code improved plus new
            function dde_version_between
<ul><li> Doc for objectPath extended. See Ref Man/Object System/New Object System Methods/objectPath</li>

    <li> The "last" function has been extended to work on NodeList and HTMLCollection</li>

    <li><code>out</code> function now takes another arg: "code" controls formatting of the output as rendered HTML or code.
        Default null gets its real value (true or false) from the new checkbox named "Code" in the
        Output pane. The label for the "Save on Eval" checkbox has been reduced to "Save"
        to make room for this new checkbox.
        Just like simulate, the value of this checkbox is persistent.</li>

    <li> option click now selects more expressions such as function calls (when you click on the function name)
        and variable declarations (when you click on let and var)
        Edit menu item changed from "Select call" to "Select expr".</li>

    <li> <code>inspect</code> doc improved slightly. Now click help gives you a link to the doc on it in the User Guide.</li>

    <li> <code>Duration</code> class simplified: defaults for all 4 arguments is now 0.
        Passing just the first argument gives you hours, not milliseconds.
        To pass only milliseconds, example: new Duration(0, 0, 0, 123) for 123 ms.
        new Duration instance method: to_seconds()
        See Ref Man/Units Systems/Duration.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug for generator instructions that wasn't utilizing all the "generated" instructions.</li>

    <li> Slight improvement to Generator Job Example 4b and Job Example 4c, the job definitions.</li>

    <li> Jobs menu/Insert Example/  added new item:
         Robot.go_to with several jobs using the Robot.go_to instruction</li>

    <li> dde_version_equal, dde_version_less_than dde_version_more_than renamed to not start with "dde_".
         doc and click_help improved.</li>

    <li> New function:  <code>dde_version_between("1.2.3", null, warn=false)</code>
      If the current version is NOT 1.2.3, then
    if first arg is null, the default, dde version must be before the 2nd arg.
    If 2nd arg is null, the default dde version must be after the first arg.
    If both are null ??? maybe just error.
    if 3rd arg (warn) is false (the default) then error if dde_version is not between first and 2nd arg (inclusive)
    else if warn is true, just print out a warning message.
    This is kind of a "declaration" at the top of a dde src file.
    See Ref Man/Operating System,etc.  dde_version_between</li>


    <li> New global var <code>loading_file</code> bound to the path of the loading file.
        See Ref Man/IO/File Access/loading_file.
        This is used to print error messages indicating errors in loading files,
        but may be useful for users loading special files.</li>

    <li> Click help printing of values of variables improved.</li>

    <li> Extended <code>Human.enter_choice</code> doc with an example of Yes & No buttons returning true or false.</li>

<ul>
    <li>New Instructions: <code>Dexter.pid_move_all_joints</code>,
        <code>Dexter.pid_move_to</code></li>

    <li> <code>beep</code>: the "duration" argument has been respelled to "dur",
        conforming with Note, Phrase, and other places.
        Because beep takes its arguments as keywords, this is an incompatibility.</li>

    <li> Fixed history recording of Find button for first history item.</li>

    <li> When you initialized a job's user data to a var with an array or lit obj
        as its data, then when restarting a job, it used to
        keep the content of whatever was pushed into that array when
        the job was restarted. Now it initializes the user-data var's value of
        an array to a copy of its original self.</li>

    <li>DXF J5 direction bug fixed</li>

    <li> Default value (functions) for DXF.init_drawing and Dexter.draw_dxf

    <li> New menu: Insert/Machine Vision/
        now contains "Convert to B&W" (from the previous version of DDE, but
        with a larger window size to accommodate bigger pictures)<br/>
        and a new item: "Process Webcam" which displays the video from
        a laptop webcam, let's you take a snapshot, then processes

          if doc exists on that instruction.</li>

    <li>  Now documented in Ref Man and with click help: All 7 temperature conversion
          functions. See Ref Man/Units System/</li>

    <li> fixed bug in make_url with lack of ampersands between args in the result.</li>

    <li>  move_to_relative modified to fully use new Kin.J_angles_to_xyz</li>

    <li>  fixed bug in run_instruction dialog with move_to.</li>

    <li>  fixed bug in Dexter.move_to with wrong defaulting of args.</li>

    <li> kinematics range bug fixed.</li>

    <li> jobs now stop when they error.</li>


    <li> the FIND algorithm changed. Now searching for "dexter kin"
         will find only terms that contain "dexter" followed by a space,
        followed by "kin", NOT all instances of "dexter" and all instances of "kin.
        This permits more accurate searches.
        All are case insensitive.</li>

    <li>   DDE can now turn the code examples of Ref Man into TestSuite.
    This test suite is automatically created and run when you choose:
    DDE menu bar/Tests/Run All TestSuites.
    It now contains 487 tests, all passing, and helps immensely in keeping
    the examples in the Ref Man will be kept up to date with the code.
    As part of this project, the expected results of examples now have a pale
    green background. About 60 examples and a bunch of underlying code
    was fixed in this process.</li>

    <li>New help item to top of units series menu that scrolls to Unit System doc.</li>

</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Convert V.1 to V.2</summary>
DDE Jobs written in DDE version 1 will likely break in DDE version 2 because
we have changed the default units for:
<ul><li><b>angles</b> from arcseconds to degrees <br/>
                      (3600 times lower value for the same effect).<br/>
                      Affects instructions: <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code>,
                     <code>Dexter.move_all_joints_relative</code>.
                     The Dexter.set_parameter names that contain <code>Boundry</code>
                     have changed from referring to arcseconds to referring to degrees.</li>
<li><b>lengths</b> from microns to meters<br/>
                   (1M times lower value for the same effect).<br/>
                   Affects instructions: <code>Dexter.move_to</code>,
                   <code>Dexter.move_to_relative</code>.</li>
<li><b>durations</b> from milliseconds to seconds <br/>
                    (1K times lower value for the same effect).<br/>
                 Affects <code>Robot.wait_until</code> when passed a number,
                 <code>Dexter.sleep</code> instruction,
         and Job's <code>inter_do_item_dur</code>,
         all of which now expect durations in seconds.<br/>
  Note that inter_do_item_dur's default has also changed from 100 milliseocnds
  to 10 milliseconds, which should increase job running speed slightly. <br/>
  The Dexter.set_parameter names of <code>MaxSpeed</code>, <code>StartSpeed</code>,
  <code>Acceleration</code> have also changed into now being "seconds" based.
  </li>
</ul>
To convert your Jobs to the new units, search for each of the names
in white above and adjust their arguments accordingly. If you want
to preserve the actual numbers, you can leave them in place but
enter a "conversion suffix" after them using
our new <i>Units System</i> See doc pane/Ref Man/Units System.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 2.0.0, June 27, 2017 private</summary>
    Incompatible Changes: We have adopted SI standard units throughout DDE,
    meaning that we will use: meters, degrees, kilograms, seconds where feasible.
    In particular:<br/>
    Angles are now specified in degrees, not arcseconds.
    Lengths are specified in meters, not microns.
    Durations mostly now specified in seconds, not milliseconds.
    We expect these changes will break most jobs, however, its simple to fix them using
    our new units system.
    <p/>
    Highlights: New "units" system to help convert numerical values into SI units.
    New top level article in Doc Pane: "Dexter Kinematics".
    DDE menu bar/Jobs/Run Instruction is now clickable and pops up a multi-instruction dialog.
    Click help now works in Command input (in Output pane header) and code examples in Doc pane.

<ul><li>units system for converting numbers into SI units.
    <li>show_window buttons extended to look at name and id before value for
        binding the clicked_button_value</li>

    <li> ref man now has all JavaScript examples formatted in white for easier identification.</li>

    <li> The command input typein now has click help.
         Type in something and click within it,
         and you'll see the same click help that you see when
         you click on that thing in the editor.</li>

    <li> The "code" examples in the doc pane (white background)
         now have click help.</li>

    <li> New top level article in Doc pane: "Dexter Kinematics"</li>

    <li> Now the simulator is keeping track of set_parameter (oplet "S") instructions.</li>

    <li> Now the simulator is handling and keeping track of write (oplet "w") instructions.</li>

    <li> The simulator more faithfully simulates "empty_instruction_queue_immediately"</li>

    <li> The previous release added a DDE menu bar menu Jobs/move dexter0.
         This has been renamed to Jobs/Run Instruction.
         Clicking on "Run Instruction" itself pops up a dialog allowing
         you more control over running an instruction on Dexter
         including:
         <ul>
             <li>move_to</li>
             <li>move_to_relative</li>
             <li>move_all_joints</li>
             <li>move_all_joints_relative</li>
             <li>empty_instruction_queue_immediate</li>
             <li>switching between the 4 Dexter modes</li>
             <li>sending instructions to any defined Dexter (not just dexter0)</li>
         </ul>
    </li>
    <li> show_window has been extended to handle onchange events for SELECT tags.</li>

    <li> The comment at the top of DDE menubar/Insert/show_window/onchange calls
         has been improved. The Ref Man for show_window now has a brief
         section for onchange.</li>

    <li> move_to and move_to_relative now check for out of range positions
        and error if they are passed them.</li>

    <li> Before the "move_all_joints" instruction (oplet "a") is sent
         to Dexter, its angles in degrees are converted into the arcseconds
         that Dexter requires.</li>

    <li> The method: <code>Dexter.xyz_invalid</code> has been removed.</li>

    <li>Dexter instruction: <code>Dexter.set_keep_position_lock</code>
        has been renamed to Dexter.set_open_loop<li>

    <li>Many changes for converting DDE to SI units including, but not limited to:
        <ul><li>Constants: Dexter.HOME_ANGLES, Dexter.NEURAL_ANGLES Dexter.PARKED_ANGLES converted
                from arcsecondss to degrees.</li>
             <li>move_to, got rid of its 3 base_* args.</li>

             <li>J5_direction can now accept an array of 2 items,
                  each is in degrees (an angle).
                  See RefMan/Robots/Dexter/Dexter Instructions/move_to/J5_direction</li>

             <li>Making a new Dexter robot has had its 3 base_* params replaced with the
                  "pose" param.</li>

            <li> Dexter.move_to if J5_direction and/or config are passed in as null,
                 then get their values from the existing angles in the robot.</li>

             <li>move_to now errors if passed a J5_direction of <br/>
                [90, 90] [-90, -90], [-90 90] or [90, -90]</li>

             <li>wait_until no longer accepts a Duration instance as its first arg.
                 You can still pass it a number, but this number is now
                 interpreted as seconds, not milliseconds.</li>

            <li> beep now takes its duration in seconds, not milliseconds</li>
            <li> The constant Dexter.MAX_SPEED  now has a value of 30 (was 100)
                  and is in units  "degrees per second" not "arcseconds per millisecond"</li>
            <li>  New value: Dexter.MAX_SPEED = 30 // degrees per second</li>

            <li> New value: Dexter.START_SPEED = .05 // degrees per second</li>

            <li> New contant: Dexter.HOME_POSITION    = [0, 0.08255, 0.866775] //meters</li>
            <li> New contant: Dexter.NEUTRAL_POSITION = [0, 0.5,     0.075],   //meters</li>

            <li> Before sending S params of :
                 MaxSpeed, StartSpeed, Acceleration,
                 there values are converted via: Math.round(MaxSpeed * _nbits_cf)</li>
            <li>Before sending S param of: JBoundries,
                 it is now converted to arcseconds.</li>

            <li> All Job examples converted from microns, arcseconds, milliseconds to
                  meters, degrees, seconds.</li>

            <li> Dexter instance variable "xyz" removed.</li>
        </ul>

    Highlights: New Robot simulation options "both" (experimental) and null.
                Bug fixes to simulate, send_to_job, serial port
<ul>
    <li> serial port error message fixes.</li>
    <li> fixed bug in running serial jobs that accidentally skipped the
        first instruction of the job.</li>
    <li>fixed bug in grab_robot_status and its documentation.</li>
    <li>fixed bug in that explicitly declaring new Dexter({simulate:false}),
        DDE still used the value of the Jobs menu "Simulate?" item.</li>
    <li><code>robot.simulate</code> now has 2 more options.
        In addition to true and false, we now have <code>"both"</code> and <code>null</code>.
        "both" means it does both simulate and "real" simultaneously.
         but note, these are not perfectly in sync.
        <code>null</code> means: get the value for robot.simulate from
             the Jobs menu item "Simulate?" which
            is persistent across DDE launches.
            See new doc in Ref Man, "new Dexter parameters" under "simulate".
            <p/>
        The Dexter init param: <code>simulate_from</code> is no longer used.
        Please search for and remove uses of it if you have any.
    </li>
    <li> Job Examples updated:
         <ul><li>Jobs/Example 0 (brand new), simplest, just a 1 instruction job with no doc.</li>
             <li>Jobs/Example 1 with new simulate architecture.</li>
             <li>Jobs/Example 4a updated</li>
             <li>Jobs/Example 4c by fixing bug in Job initialization.</li>
             <li>Jobs/Example 4d Updated to take advantage of <code>Job.start</code>'s initial_instruction param.</li>
             <li>Jobs/Example 9  fixed typo in serial port.</li>
         </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Fixed <code>send_to_job</code>, 2 bugs: the setting of user_data via functions passed into the instruction,
         and a bug with sending to a job that has yet to be started.
        New documentation in the Ref Man under send_to_job, start param

        is now persistent accross DDE launches.</li>

    <li>Now clicking the stop sign doesn't change the color of the button
        for jobs that have been defined but never run.</li>

    <li>hdrobotic.com DDE documentation display:
       <ul>

</details>


<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 1.0.11, Apr 10, 2017</summary>
    Highlights: DDE now communicating with Dexter. New default robot is Robot.dexter0.
                Extensions to dde_init.js and dde_persistent.json mean rarely having
                to define a robot with your Job definitions. "Start Job" and "Simulate?"
                menu items reduce now-extranious code in Job definition file and ease
                switching between simulate and real.
<ul>
    <li> Now access to files outside of the user's Documents/dde_apps/ folder is restricted.
                This is to prevent potentially malicious code running within DDE.</li>

    <li> <code>write_file</code> doc updated.</li>

    <li> <code>persistent_clear</code> renamed to <code>persistent_initialize</code> and
         the functionality was extended. Doc updated.</li>

    <li> Stop all jobs is now closing (disconnecting) the job's robot if its a Dexter.</li>

    <li> DDE now communicating with Dexter.</li>

    <li> dde_persistent.json now has a comment at top of file.</li>

    <li> A comment above release notes now says some releases have no release notes.</li>

    <li> Now you can edit the font size by typing, and hitting ENTER
         causes the new font size to take effect.</li>

    <li> Now clicking anywhere in the menu item of
        the "Real time sim" menu item toggles the checkbox.</li>

    <li> Choosing series menu item "Test Suite" now inserts
        the first test suite.ISSUE: Series>Test Suite, didn't seem to do anything.</li>

    <li> Replaced: "There is nothing[blue] in the editor" with
          "The Editor is empty. Type to insert text."</li>

    <li> Choosing Editor menu item Undo now works.</li>

    <li> Replaced editor menu item of:
        "Right click menu has more ops". with
        "Right click menu in JS pane has more operations."</li>

    <li> New default robot is <code>Robot.dexter0</code>.</li>

    <li> New items in dde_init.js and dde_persistent.json
        new initialization of these files to make configuration easier.
        Once you configure dexter0 in dde_init.js, mostly
        you won't have to touch it again, or use another robot.
        Thus defining a robot in a Job definition file becomes unnecessary.</li>

    <li> new Jobs menu item "Simulate?" checkbox.
        This sets the persistent variable: "default_dexter_simulate"
        and that's used when a job using dexter0 is starting.</li>

    <li> Dexter robot objects now have a property: <code>simulate_from</code>
        If this is has the value: <code>"persistent_get"</code> (the default)
        then every time a job is started with this robot,
        the robot's simulate flag is set to the value of
        <code>persistent_get("default_dexter_simulate")</code>
        Please see new doc in the ref man on Dexter and its parameter: simulate_from.</li>
</ul>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 1.0.10, Apr 2, 2017</summary>
    Highlights: Start Job menu item. New JS type-in, recognize_speech mostly working.
<ul>
<li> Doc, Output and Simulation pane headers fixed to not wrap when pane is shrunk.</li>

    <li> Rearranged Output pane header widgets.</li>

    <li> Added JS/ROS radio buttons to Output pane header.
    When JS is selected (the default), hitting enter evals
    the typed in JS. up and down arrows navigate js cmd history.</li>

    <li> html code tags now display with a white background helping them
    stand out better in the documentation.</li>

    <li><code>recognize_speech</code> working pretty well. Still some minor issues
        depending on the click_to_talk and only_once arguments. Interacts poorly with
        <code>speak</code>.</li>

    <li> Change in new object system that broke Coord system fixed,
        but still 4 bugs in Coord system test suite.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 1.0.9, Mar 25, 2017</summary>
    Highlights: Updating DDE much easier. Robot.start_job and Robot.stop_job.
    Improved Doc. Job init param: ending_program_counter.
<ul>
<li> When using Doc pane Find button, better help text printed in
Output pane.</li>

<li> <code>Robot.wait_until</code> can now take an instruction_location
    (only arrays and lit objs format accepted) as it argument
    to wait until that instruction_location is reached in another job.</li>

<li>when DDE launches it prints in the output pane its
DDE version and date. If its not the latest release,
it tells you what is and how to get it.</li>

<li> "Update..." is a new File menu item that tells you the same thing.</li>

<li> Removed DDE Dexter instructions: <code>move_all_joints_relative</code>
     and <code>move_to_relative</code>. Just use the new coord sys.</li>

<li> Documented "Any Function Def" as a kind of instruction in a do_list,
   under Ref Man Robot. This was an important omission: recommended reading!</li>

<li> User Guide 'Installation" now documents new github process.</li>

<li> New instruction <code>Robot.start_job</code>
    let's you start other jobs flexibly from within a job.</li>

<li>New init option for a job (and the start function)
    <code>ending_program_counter</code> allows you to
    declare at the outset to stop a job early.
    Can be any instruction_location.</li>

<li> Extended instruction: <code>Robot.stop_job</code>  (renamed from Robot.stop)
  Now takes an instruction_location so it can stop other jobs
  AND stop them at any of their instructions.</li>

<li> <code>beep</code> and <code>beeps</code> now documented in the ref man with click help.</li>

<li> Click help on [ and ] now works.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 1.0.4, Mar 16, 2017</summary>
Highlights: New Electron Framework, New instruction Robot.grab_robot_status,
Serial Port extensions, file access improved, dxf improvements,
go_to instruction and friends, better help in finding doc.
Please read Known Issues.
<ul>
    <li>Electron Framework replaces Google Chrome App. Facilitates
    single JavaScript environment and utilization of node.js packages.</li>

    <li>The persistent db is now stored in a file named dde_apps/persistent.json
    Unlike the previous DDE, you can now look at this file in  text editor
    and easily see exactly what's in it. If you edit this file.
    do so when DDE is not running because dde will over-write it.
    You can even move this file to another installation of DDE
    and have it work.</li>

    <li>Switching between files now remembers the old scroll position and
    selection of a file so that if you switch back to it, it scrolls
    to (almost) the same place and highlights the selection.</li>

    <li>If the "file" you are editing is "new file", and you quit and
    relaunch DDE, you will be showed an empty "new file" in the editor
    instead of one of your previously edited files.</li>

    <li>The get_page function is now syncrhonus. It does not
    take a callback, and it returns the contents of the url
    in its argument. A new function get_page_asynchronous
    <i>does</i> take a callback and does <i>not</i> return
    the contents of the url in its first argument.
    </li>

    <li> Robot.get_page has changed slightly incompatibly
    in a similar way to the get_page function call.
    Its first argument is a url_or_options,
    Its second arg is response_variable_name.
    There are no other arguments.
    The Get_page instruction cause the job to not advance to the next instruction
    until the get_page request has completed.
    If get_page has errored, the response_variable_name will contain
    a string starting with: "Error: "</li>

    <li>The Dexter and job for calibration is no longer defined upon start up.
    You have to call:
    init_calibration()
    This returns the job, which you can then do:
    init_calibration().start()  to start the job.
    We'll be making this easier in the near future.
    </li>

    <li>job examples 3 & 7 improved.</li>

    <li> file_content now doesn't take a callback and just returns the string
    of the content of the file indicated in the path of its first argument.</li>

    <li>load_files now doesn't take a callback and just returns the value of the
    last expression in the last file loaded.
    The "paths" parameter to load_files has been simplified. See the ref man doc.</li>

    <li> minor improvements to SVG examples. All SVG examples work.</li>

    <li> Documentation: added into the doc pane,
    the url to the HDRobotic video page (under About) and the DDE video
    (under "User Interface")</li>

    <li> serial port improvements:
      <ul><li> serial_devices() returns a list of available serial port devices.</li>
          <li>serial_path_to_info_map holds an object for each connected serial port device.</li>
          <li>New Job Example 9 for Serial Port & Arduino tutorial </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Job Examples now on a submenu under the Jobs menu.</li>

    <li>Removed job instance field: robot_status. It as redundant and error prone.
         Use Job.j1.robot.rotbut_status to get it if you need it,
        but you won't because ....</li>

    <li>New instruction Robot.grab_robot_status makes getting at
        data in robot_status much easier</li>

    <li> newObject now ignores "name" arg if it is null or undefined.
        But if it is some OTHER non-string, newObject errors.</li>
    <li> <code>Root</code> is a new global variable that holds the
       root of the object system. So all object systems paths should
       now start with Root.</li>

    <li> Dexter.draw_dxf fixed bug that ignored the 3rd argument and always treated it as 2000</li>
    <li>Dexter.draw_dxf first argument is usually a string <= 512 long
      that ends in .dxf or .DXF. If it does not, the first argument
      will be assumed to be a string of actual dxf code.</li>

    <li> File access is restricted to files under the "dde_apps" folder in your
    Documents folder. You no longer need to set up a server to access these files,
    or to have edited them first.</li>

    <li>  You can now use the JavaScript functions: alert, confirm, prompt,
    quite useful for debugging and rapid prototyping.</li>

    <li> tweaks to the UI to make it "fit" better.</li>

    <li> New "Eval Doc" button in the Doc pane. Let's you evaluated
    a selected code example in the Doc pane and see the result
    in the output pane.</li>

    <li> Replaced the individual videos with
    just one url to the hdrobotic.com video page.
    </li>

    <li> new instruction Robot.label("a string"), its a no-op but provides
      target for go_to.</li>

    <li> new instruction Robot.go_to(instruction_location)
      "jumps" the program counter. Lots of functionality in ref man doc.</li>

    <li> Now clicking on TestSuite gives you click help with an underlined
    "TestSuite" that you can click on to see documentation.</li>

    <li>job.start  now can take "program_counter" and its an instruction_location
    to init the program_counter to something other than the first instruction.
    The default is 0, meaning first instruction on do_list is the first one run.
    Like "go_to" at the beginning of a job.</li>

    <li> job.start now can take initial_instruction as an instruction to run first.
    This replaces the old param to Job.start of "sent_from_job" which was
    used when a non-started job was sent an instruction.
    The new initial_instruction is much more general since it can be used
    when creating a job, when calling Job.start or by send_to_job.
    The default is "no instruction". When it exists and
    a job is started, the initial_instruction is run just BEFORE the
    instruction at the initialized program_counter (which defaults to 0).</li>

    <li> The documentation "About" section now shows the release date of
    the DDE version loaded.</li>

    <li> load_files ref man documentation now has examples.</li>

    <li> dde_init.js now documented (under "Installation/Launch DDE").</li>

    <li>  start method now takes a program_counter
       program_counter: allow a new items: "highest_completed_instruction"
    and "highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"
    So that if the job errors, and pc init is "highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"
    we DON"T reset the do_list to the orig do_list,
    but keep it the same, and go and grab the id of the
    instruction that errored and use it.</li>

    <li>  Instruction.Control.send_to_job no longer takes a "to_job_name"
    as an explicit parameter, however,
    the where_to_start param can be any instruction_location
    used by Robot.go_to, or program_counter setting.
    Can include a job property but defaults to "this job".</li>

    <li>  New static method Job: Job.insert_instruction(instruction, location )
      where location same format as go_to, setting program_counter.</li>

    <li>  sent_from_job was documented but I've undocumented it.
     Users should use new facilities in
    new job and start's initial_instruction, Job.insert_instruction.</li>

    <li>  Instruction Robot.wait_until extended to take new value for
       its argument "new_instruction" meaning
    when wait_until first gets called, it captures the
    instruction after it (which could be none, if the wait_until is
    the last instruction), then waits until
    the next instruction is different,
    then it unpauses.
    Often put on the end of a do_list, or maybe the only thing
    initially on a do_list, and waits until something gets on it.</li>

    <li> If the search type-in box is empty when you click the doc "Find" button,
    the selected text in the Doc, Editor, or Output pane is used,
    as noted in the new tooltip for the Find type-in box.</li>
</ul>
