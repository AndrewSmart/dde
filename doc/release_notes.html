<details style="padding-left:20px;"><summary>v 1.0.11, Apr 10, 2017</summary>
    Highlights: DDE now communicating with Dexter. New default robot is Robot.dexter0.
                Extensions to dde_init.js and dde_persistent.json mean rarely having
                to define a robot with your Job definitions. "Start Job" and "Simulate?"
                menu items reduce now-extranious code in Job definition file and ease
                switching between simulate and real.
<ul>
    <li> Now access to files outside of the user's Documents/dde_apps/ folder is restricted.
                This is to prevent potentially malicious code running within DDE.</li>

    <li> <code>write_file</code> doc updated.</li>

    <li> <code>persistent_clear</code> renamed to <code>persistent_initialize</code> and
         the functionality was extended. Doc updated.</li>

    <li> Stop all jobs is now closing (disconnecting) the job's robot if its a Dexter.</li>

    <li> DDE now communicating with Dexter.</li>

    <li> dde_persistent.json now has a comment at top of file.</li>

    <li> A comment above release notes now says some releases have no release notes.</li>

    <li> Now you can edit the font size by typing, and hitting ENTER
         causes the new font size to take effect.</li>

    <li> Now clicking anywhere in the menu item of
        the "Real time sim" menu item toggles the checkbox.</li>

    <li> Choosing series menu item "Test Suite" now inserts
        the first test suite.ISSUE: Series>Test Suite, didn't seem to do anything.</li>

    <li> Replaced: "There is nothing[blue] in the editor" with
          "The Editor is empty. Type to insert text."</li>

    <li> Choosing Editor menu item Undo now works.</li>

    <li> Replaced editor menu item of:
        "Right click menu has more ops". with
        "Right click menu in JS pane has more operations."</li>

    <li> New default robot is <code>Robot.dexter0</code>.</li>

    <li> New items in dde_init.js and dde_persistent.json
        new initialization of these files to make configuration easier.
        Once you configure dexter0 in dde_init.js, mostly
        you won't have to touch it again, or use another robot.
        Thus defining a robot in a Job definition file becomes unnecessary.</li>

    <li> new Jobs menu item "Simulate?" checkbox.
        This sets the persistent variable: "default_dexter_simulate"
        and that's used when a job using dexter0 is starting.</li>

    <li> Dexter robot objects now have a property: <code>simulate_from</code>
        If this is has the value: <code>"persistent_get"</code> (the default)
        then every time a job is started with this robot,
        the robot's simulate flag is set to the value of
        <code>persistent_get("default_dexter_simulate")</code>
        Please see new doc in the ref man on Dexter and its parameter: simulate_from.</li>
</ul>

<details style="padding-left:20px;"><summary>v 1.0.10, Apr 2, 2017</summary>
    Highlights: Start Job menu item. New JS type-in, recognize_speech mostly working.
<ul>
<li> Doc, Output and Simulation pane headers fixed to not wrap when pane is shrunk.</li>

    <li> Rearranged Output pane header widgets.</li>

    <li> Added JS/ROS radio buttons to Output pane header.
    When JS is selected (the default), hitting enter evals
    the typed in JS. up and down arrows navigate js cmd history.</li>

    <li> github README and releases page documentation extended.</li>

    <li> new Jobs Menu "Start Job" item (and "Start Job help" menu item).
         Choose menu item "Start Job help" for details.</li>

    <li> html code tags now display with a white background helping them
    stand out better in the documentation.</li>

    <li><code>recognize_speech</code> working pretty well. Still some minor issues
        depending on the click_to_talk and only_once arguments. Interacts poorly with
        <code>speak</code>.</li>

    <li> Change in new object system that broke Coord system fixed,
        but still 4 bugs in Coord system test suite.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details style="padding-left:20px;"><summary>v 1.0.9, Mar 25, 2017</summary>
    Highlights: Updating DDE much easier. Robot.start_job and Robot.stop_job.
    Improved Doc. Job init param: ending_program_counter.
<ul>
<li> When using Doc pane Find button, better help text printed in
Output pane.</li>

<li> <code>Robot.wait_until</code> can now take an instruction_location
    (only arrays and lit objs format accepted) as it argument
    to wait until that instruction_location is reached in another job.</li>

<li>when DDE launches it prints in the output pane its
DDE version and date. If its not the latest release,
it tells you what is and how to get it.</li>

<li> "Update..." is a new File menu item that tells you the same thing.</li>

<li> Removed DDE Dexter instructions: <code>move_all_joints_relative</code>
     and <code>move_to_relative</code>. Just use the new coord sys.</li>

<li> Documented "Any Function Def" as a kind of instruction in a do_list,
   under Ref Man Robot. This was an important omission: recommended reading!</li>

<li> User Guide 'Installation" now documents new github process.</li>

<li> New instruction <code>Robot.start_job</code>
    let's you start other jobs flexibly from within a job.</li>

<li>New init option for a job (and the start function)
    <code>ending_program_counter</code> allows you to
    declare at the outset to stop a job early.
    Can be any instruction_location.</li>

<li> Extended instruction: <code>Robot.stop_job</code>  (renamed from Robot.stop)
  Now takes an instruction_location so it can stop other jobs
  AND stop them at any of their instructions.</li>

<li> <code>beep</code> and <code>beeps</code> now documented in the ref man with click help.</li>

<li> Click help on [ and ] now works.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details style="padding-left:20px;"><summary>v 1.0.4, Mar 16, 2017</summary>
Highlights: New Electron Framework, New instruction Robot.grab_robot_status,
Serial Port extensions, file access improved, dxf improvements,
go_to instruction and friends, better help in finding doc.
Please read Known Issues.
<ul>
    <li>Electron Framework replaces Google Chrome App. Facilitates
    single JavaScript environment and utilization of node.js packages.</li>

    <li>The persistent db is now stored in a file named dde_apps/persistent.json
    Unlike the previous DDE, you can now look at this file in  text editor
    and easily see exactly what's in it. If you edit this file.
    do so when DDE is not running because dde will over-write it.
    You can even move this file to another installation of DDE
    and have it work.</li>

    <li>Switching between files now remembers the old scroll position and
    selection of a file so that if you switch back to it, it scrolls
    to (almost) the same place and highlights the selection.</li>

    <li>If the "file" you are editing is "new file", and you quit and
    relaunch DDE, you will be showed an empty "new file" in the editor
    instead of one of your previously edited files.</li>

    <li>The get_page function is now syncrhonus. It does not
    take a callback, and it returns the contents of the url
    in its argument. A new function get_page_asynchronous
    <i>does</i> take a callback and does <i>not</i> return
    the contents of the url in its first argument.
    </li>

    <li> Robot.get_page has changed slightly incompatibly
    in a similar way to the get_page function call.
    Its first argument is a url_or_options,
    Its second arg is response_variable_name.
    There are no other arguments.
    The Get_page instruction cause the job to not advance to the next instruction
    until the get_page request has completed.
    If get_page has errored, the response_variable_name will contain
    a string starting with: "Error: "</li>

    <li>The Dexter and job for calibration is no longer defined upon start up.
    You have to call:
    init_calibration()
    This returns the job, which you can then do:
    init_calibration().start()  to start the job.
    We'll be making this easier in the near future.
    </li>

    <li>job examples 3 & 7 improved.</li>

    <li> file_content now doesn't take a callback and just returns the string
    of the content of the file indicated in the path of its first argument.</li>

    <li>load_files now doesn't take a callback and just returns the value of the
    last expression in the last file loaded.
    The "paths" parameter to load_files has been simplified. See the ref man doc.</li>

    <li> minor improvements to SVG examples. All SVG examples work.</li>

    <li> Documentation: added into the doc pane,
    the url to the HDRobotic video page (under About) and the DDE video
    (under "User Interface")</li>

    <li> serial port improvements:
      <ul><li> serial_devices() returns a list of available serial port devices.</li>
          <li>serial_path_to_info_map holds an object for each connected serial port device.</li>
          <li>New Job Example 9 for Serial Port & Arduino tutorial </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Job Examples now on a submenu under the Jobs menu.</li>

    <li>Removed job instance field: robot_status. It as redundant and error prone.
         Use Job.j1.robot.rotbut_status to get it if you need it,
        but you won't because ....</li>

    <li>New instruction Robot.grab_robot_status makes getting at
        data in robot_status much easier</li>

    <li> newObject now ignores "name" arg if it is null or undefined.
        But if it is some OTHER non-string, newObject errors.</li>
    <li> <code>Root</code> is a new global variable that holds the
       root of the object system. So all object systems paths should
       now start with Root.</li>

    <li> Dexter.draw_dxf fixed bug that ignored the 3rd argument and always treated it as 2000</li>
    <li>Dexter.draw_dxf first argument is usually a string <= 512 long
      that ends in .dxf or .DXF. If it does not, the first argument
      will be assumed to be a string of actual dxf code.</li>

    <li> File access is restricted to files under the "dde_apps" folder in your
    Documents folder. You no longer need to set up a server to access these files,
    or to have edited them first.</li>

    <li>  You can now use the JavaScript functions: alert, confirm, prompt,
    quite useful for debugging and rapid prototyping.</li>

    <li> tweaks to the UI to make it "fit" better.</li>

    <li> New "Eval Doc" button in the Doc pane. Let's you evaluated
    a selected code example in the Doc pane and see the result
    in the output pane.</li>

    <li> Replaced the individual videos with
    just one url to the hdrobotic.com video page.
    </li>

    <li> new instruction Robot.label("a string"), its a no-op but provides
      target for go_to.</li>

    <li> new instruction Robot.go_to(instruction_location)
      "jumps" the program counter. Lots of functionality in ref man doc.</li>

    <li> Now clicking on TestSuite gives you click help with an underlined
    "TestSuite" that you can click on to see documentation.</li>

    <li>job.start  now can take "program_counter" and its an instruction_location
    to init the program_counter to something other than the first instruction.
    The default is 0, meaning first instruction on do_list is the first one run.
    Like "go_to" at the beginning of a job.</li>

    <li> job.start now can take initial_instruction as an instruction to run first.
    This replaces the old param to Job.start of "sent_from_job" which was
    used when a non-started job was sent an instruction.
    The new initial_instruction is much more general since it can be used
    when creating a job, when calling Job.start or by send_to_job.
    The default is "no instruction". When it exists and
    a job is started, the initial_instruction is run just BEFORE the
    instruction at the initialized program_counter (which defaults to 0).</li>

    <li> The documentation "About" section now shows the release date of
    the DDE version loaded.</li>

    <li> load_files ref man documentation now has examples.</li>

    <li> dde_init.js now documented (under "Installation/Launch DDE").</li>

    <li>  start method now takes a program_counter
       program_counter: allow a new items: "highest_completed_instruction"
    and "highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"
    So that if the job errors, and pc init is "highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"
    we DON"T reset the do_list to the orig do_list,
    but keep it the same, and go and grab the id of the
    instruction that errored and use it.</li>

    <li>  Instruction.Control.send_to_job no longer takes a "to_job_name"
    as an explicit parameter, however,
    the where_to_start param can be any instruction_location
    used by Robot.go_to, or program_counter setting.
    Can include a job property but defaults to "this job".</li>

    <li>  New static method Job: Job.insert_instruction(instruction, location )
      where location same format as go_to, setting program_counter.</li>

    <li>  sent_from_job was documented but I've undocumented it.
     Users should use new facilities in
    new job and start's initial_instruction, Job.insert_instruction.</li>

    <li>  Instruction Robot.wait_until extended to take new value for
       its argument "new_instruction" meaning
    when wait_until first gets called, it captures the
    instruction after it (which could be none, if the wait_until is
    the last instruction), then waits until
    the next instruction is different,
    then it unpauses.
    Often put on the end of a do_list, or maybe the only thing
    initially on a do_list, and waits until something gets on it.</li>

    <li> If the search type-in box is empty when you click the doc "Find" button,
    the selected text in the Doc, JavaScript, or Output pane is used,
    as noted in the new tooltip for the Find type-in box.</li>
</ul>
