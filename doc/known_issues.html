     This section lists the significant problems we are aware of
with this DDE release. All of them are on our "do list".
<p></p>
<ul>
   <li>Using files of images on your computer in the machine vision
       demos no longer work. Using live images from your webcam still works.</li>
   <li>The extensions of release 2.5.0 are not documented other than
       in the release notes.</li>
   <li>Picture.detect_blobs: the data about each blob is inconsistent with
       itself. detect_blobs <i>appears</i> to work but actual x, y locations
       for each blob are wrong.</li>
   <li>Picture.show_video() sometimes comes up with a blank video, not showing the
       output of your webcam. Often just closing the show_window that is attempting
       to display the video and starting over will work.
       This intermittent problem also occurs when calling Picture.take_picture
       which needs webcam output.</li>
    <!-- not sure this is really needed with the new timeout<li>Do not attempt to run a Job while Dexter is in the process of booting.
        Wait for its "dance" to be over. </li> -->
    <li>Speech Recognition is busted.</li>
    <li>The new subsystems in DDE of ezTeach FindHome, to_source_code, OpenCV, and
        Drawing with DXF are works in progress. They need better support,
        and their API may change.</li>
    <li>Dexter Kinematics article in doc pane is incomplete.</li>
    <li>None of the apps for the 3 platforms are "signed", thus you get warnings
        when installing them about being "untrusted". You might have
        to turn off virus protection, or click right on the
        <code>dexter_dev_env</code> file to launch it.
    </li>
    <li>Documentation for Dexter's low level software is incomplete.</li>
    <li>When recognize_speech can connect to the server it *can* work well.
        but we've had some problems, especially on Windows 7.</li>
    <li>Linux release poorly tested.</li>
    <li>Dexter.run_gcode needs many extensions.</li>
    <li>Train Dexter doesn't output a Job definition.</li>
    <li>Documentation on ROS functionality</li>
    <li>Support for ROS action clients needed.</li>
</ul>
