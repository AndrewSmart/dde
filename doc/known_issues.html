     This section lists the significant problems we are aware of
with this DDE release. All of them are on our "do list".
<p/>
<ul>
    <li>Dexter Kinematics article in doc pane is incomplete.</li>
    <li>None of the apps for the 3 platforms are "signed", thus you get warnings
        when installing them about being "untrusted". You might have
        to turn off virus protection, or click right on the
        <code>dexter_dev_env</code> file to launch it.
    </li>
    <li>Documentation for Dexter's low level software is incomplete.</li>
    <li>When recognize_speech can connect to the server it *can* work well.
        but we've had some problems, especially on Windows 7.</li>
    <li>Linux release poorly tested.</li>
    <li>Dexter.draw_dxf needs extension to describe the drawing plane.</li>
    <li>Dexter.run_gcode needs many extensions.</li>
    <li>Train Dexter doesn't output a Job definition.</li>
    <li>Documentation on ROS functionality</li>
    <li>Support for ROS action clients needed.</li>
</ul>
