<details style="padding-left:20px;"><summary>Known Issues</summary>
This section lists the significant problems we are aware of
with this DDE release. All of them are on our "do list".
<p/>
This version is an early release in the new Electron framework.
It is made available only for testing purposes. It is not
well tested.
In general, users should not use it. Stick with the previous Chrome Apps version
a while longer. Sorry.
<ul><li>Sending commands to hardware robot broken (but similation ok)</li>
    <li>Speech recognition busted.</li>
    <li>None of the apps for the 3 platforms are "signed", thus you get warnings
        when installing them about being "untrusted".</li>
    <li>Linux distribution has some bad behavior with the menus that probably
        precludes effective use of DDE on Linux right now.</li>
    <li>Dexter.draw_dxf needs extension to describe the drawing plane.</li>
    <li>Dexter.run_gcode needs many extensions.</li>
    <li>Some instructions lacking sections in the Reference Manual.</li>
    <li>Train Dexter doesn't output a Job definition.</li>
    <li>Documentation on ROS functionality</li>
    <li>Support for ROS action clients needed.</li>
</ul>
