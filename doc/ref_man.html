<details id="out_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>out</summary>
<code>out</code> prints its first argument into the Output pane.
The optional 2nd argument controls the color printed (default "black").<br/>
Example:<code>out("hi", "blue")</code><p/>
If you have a lot of out calls, it can be helpful to give them
different colors so you can easily find a particular one.
</details>

<details id="get_page_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>get_page</summary>
<code>get_page</code> retrieves the contents of a web page.
You pass in a url and get_page returns the contents as a string.
The argument can either be a string of a url, or a literal JS object.<br/>
Example: <code>get_page("http://ibm.com")</code><br/>
If there is an error, the returned string will start with "Error:"
and be followed by some clues as to why the error happened.
<p/>
It will not eval scripts on the page
so you may see an error when retriving a page containing JavaScript.
<p/>
Instead of a url as the argument, you can pass a literal JS object
with lots of options, described at:
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">options</a>
</details>

<details id="get_page_async_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>get_page_async</summary>
A call to get_page_async is asynchronus. It returns immediately,
but when the actual page content is finally retrieved from the web,
a callback is called and passed an error object, a response object, and the body string
of the page.
<p/>
It will not eval scripts on the page
so you may see an error when retriving a page containing JavaScript.
<p/>
Example: <pre>get_page_async("http://ibm.com",
  function(err, response, body){
     if(err) { out("get_page_async got error.") }
     else if (response.statusCode !== 200){
        out("Got an error with statusCode: " + response.statusCode)
     }
     else { out(body) }
  })</pre><br/>

<details id="make_url_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>make_url</summary>
    <i>url</i> is a poorly designed language for transfering data on the web.
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">Documentation.</a>
    It's normal behavior is as an asyncrhonous function call, where the 
    call is typically on a web device known as a 'client', and it is sent to
    a different device on the web known as a 'server'. 
    <p/>
    Usually its used to
    get the content of a web page into a browser. Usually the content of a web page
    is written in a polyglot of languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) but 
    we can use urls to retrieve data in other syntaxes such as JSON or just plain strings.
    <p/>
    <i>make_url</i> does two things:
    <ol><li>Prepends "http://" to the url being constructed, if it looks like
          there is no protocol in the url already. If there is no "://" in the
          first 16 chars of the url, it prepends "http://". If you want a
          different protocol, such as https, or you are using "://" in the value
          of an argument, you should include the protocol in the passed in url.</li>
        <li>Makes creating arguments easier and appends them to the end of the url.</li>
     </ol>
     <i>Parameters</i>:<br/>
     <b>url</b>: A string containing the base url. If the protocol is to be "http",
                you can omit it in most cases.<br/>
                Example: <code>www.ibm.com</code><br/>means the same thing as<br/>
                <code>http://www.ibm.com</code><br/>
     <b>arguments</b>: A string of arguments, formally called a <i>query string</i>.<br/>
        Example: <code>"x=123&y=45&color=blue"</code> <i>OR</i>
        A literal object with name-value pairs representing the arguments.<br/>
        Example: <pre><code>{x: 123, 
        y: 45, 
        color: "blue"}</code></pre>
        This later form makes it easy to compute and set indivudal args.<br/>
      Example:<pre>
      var args = {x: 12.3 * 10}
      args.y = 40 + 5
      make_url("www.ibm.com", args)</pre>

<details id="recognize_speech_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>recognize_speech</summary>
    Speech recognition has a long history in AI. After many decades of research, it <i>can</i>
    be useful, but don't expect it to be as reliable as a human. DDE uses Google's speech
    recognition, which sends audio over the web to be recognized on Google's servers.
    If you don't have: 
    <ul><li>a good microphone in your computer,</li>
        <li>a quiet room,</li>
        <li>a reliable net connection or</li>
        <li>a fast net connection</li>
    </ul>
        don't attempt to use recognize_speech.
    <b><i>Be sure to crank up the volume of your mic.</i></b>
    <p/>
    The recognized text is quite good compared to recognizers of the past but, like people,
    it still makes mistakes. Recognized text comes with a <b>confidence</b> number indicating
    how good the recognizer <i>thinks</i> the text is at matching what you've said.
    In theory its nice to have this confidence number but in practice, it might
    not matter much. The number varies from 1 (very confident) to 0 (very unconfident)
    though we've seen a bunch of 0 confidence numbers for perfectly fine text.
    Also in the middle of a session, you may well see network bugs even though
    it seems like your network is fine to you. 
    <p/>
    If you are using speech to dictate
    a critical process, we recommend displaying or saying (via the <b>speak</b> function)
    the recognized text and asking the user for a simple <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> confirmation.
    <p/>
    When <b>recognize_speech</b> is called, it pops up a dialog telling you to speak. 
    The arguments to recognize_speech configure this dialog and the callbacks that receive the
    recognized text and confidence numbers. All of these are keyword arguments with defaults. See
    <button>Insert&#9660;</button> menu, <b>sound/recognize_speech</b> for an example call.
    <ul><li><b>title</b> Default: "Recognize Speech". Shows in the title bar of the dialog.
        </li>
        <li><b>prompt</b> Default: "". Displays instructions for the user at the top of the dialog.
            Can be any HTML.
        </li>
        <li><b>only_once</b> Default <code>true</code>. When <code>true</code>, the dialog is automatically closed at the end of the first phrase.
                                  When <code>false</code>, the dialog re-initializes after you pause and permits another phrase to be recognized.
                                  Say <i>finish</i> to close the dialog. 
        </li>
        <li><b>click_to_talk</b> Default <code>true</code>. When <code>true</code>, the user
             must click <button>click to talk</button> to start the recognition. 
             When <code>false</code>, recognition starts as soon as the dialog is shown,
             or as soon as it has recognized the previous phrase (when <code>only_once=false</code>).
             </li>
        <li><b>width</b> Default: <code>400</code>. The distance from the left edge of the dialog to the right edge in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>height</b> Default: <code>180</code>. The distance from the top edge of the dialog to the bottom in pixels.
             If you have multiple lines for the prompt, this should be increased. 
        </li>
        <li><b>x</b> Default: <code>400</code>. The distance from the left edge of the DDE window to the left edge of the dialog in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>y</b> Default: <code>200</code>. The distance from the top edge of the DDE window to the top of the dialog in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>background_color</b> Default: <code>"rgb(238, 238, 238)"</code> i.e. light gray. Can be one of the names (strings) in the color series.
        </li>
        <li><b>phrase_callback</b> Default <code>recognize_speech_default_phrase_callback</code>.
             This function is called when the user pauses after speaking. 
             It is passed the recognized text, and the confidence number (0 to 1).
             If only_once=true, only this callback is called.
             The default prints these two arguments into the Output pane.
         </li>
        <li><b>finish_callback</b> Default <code>null</code> meaning no action.
             This function is called when the user says the finish_phrase.
             It is passed an array of arrays. Each inner array has elements of the text
             and the confidence number of each phrase spoken in this use of recognize_speech.
             This argument is moot if <code>only_once=true</code>.
         </li>
         <li><b>finish_phrase</b> Default: <code>"finish"</code>. The phrase that the user should speak to
             end the dialog. Moot when <code>only_once=true</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

<details id="speak_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>speak</summary>
<code>speak</code> uses text to speech technology.<br/>
Example:<br/>
<code>speak("hey there")</code>
By passing a literal object, you can control many aspects of <code>speak</code>.
The <code>speak_data</code> input can be more than just text. You can feed speak any JavaScript data
(such as a boolean, a number, a date, an array, etc.) and it will do its best to say it out loud.<br/>
Example:<pre> speak({speak_data: [true, "It is", new Date()],//default="hello"
        volume: 1.0,   //default=1.0   0 to 1.0,
        rate: 1.0,     //default=1.0   0.1 to 10,
        pitch: 1.0,    //default=1.0   0 to 2,
        lang: "en-US", //default="en-US"
        voice: 0,      //default=0     0, 1, 2, or 3
        callback: function(event) {out('Dur in nsecs: ' + event.elapsedTime)}  //default=null  called when speech is done.

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>File Access</summary>
Web clients reading an writing files to their local file system has been impossible in the past. 
DDE gives you programmatic read/write access to all files under the dde_apps folder
under your Documents folder, typically under the user's home folder.
<p/>
The code for your Job definitions should live under that folder (at any depth beneath
that folder).
If you do not have a dde_apps folder under your Documents folder, please create one.

<details id="dde_apps_dir_doc_id"><summary>dde_apps_dir</summary>
The folder beneath which DDE has programmatic access.
You cannot set this constant. It will have a value something like:
<code>"/Users/Fry/Documents/dde_apps"</code> on the Mac.
</details>

<details id="file_content_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>file_content</summary>
<code>file_content</code> takes an argument of a filepath, similar to <code>load_files</code>,
and returns a string of the content of the file.<br/>
<i>Parameters</i><br/>
<b>path</b> A string of a path to the file. Usually this will not start with a slash,
            but rather tha first character of a file name inside of your dde_apps folder.
            if the path starts with a path, it should be a complete path from the root
            of your file system, on through to dde_apps and the file below it.
            <br/>
<b>encoding</b> A string indicating the encoding of the file. Default: "utf8".
             The default works fine for most plain text files, including .js files.
<p/>
<b>Example:</b> <code>file_content("myfold/foo.txt"</code>
</details> <!-- end file_content -->
<details id="Editor.edit_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>Editor.edit_file</summary>
<code>Editor.edit_file</code> takes an argument of a filepath, similar to <code>load_files</code>,
and puts that file in DDE's editor. 
<p/>
Its 2nd argument is a callback that takes no arguments. It is called when the file's content
is in DDE's editor.<br/>
<b>Example:</b> <code>Editor.edit_file("/myfold/foo.txt")</code>
</details> <!-- end file_content -->

<details id="file_exists_doc_id"><summary>file_exists</summary>
Returns true if the file path in the first argument exists.<br/>
<I>Example></i><br/>
<code>file_exists("class_play.js")</code>
</details>

<details id="folder_separator_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>folder_separator</summary>
A function of no arguments that returns the character used to separate folders in a filepath.
For Windows OS's this is "\\" (backslash). 
For others its "/" (forward slash).
</details>

<details id="load_files_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>load_files</summary>
<code>load_files</code> gets the content of files from disk and evaluate
it in the DDE environment programmatically. You can pass any number of file paths to
load files. It will load the files sequentially, such that later files
can depend on the contents of earlier files loaded.
A file path that starts with a slash is expected to have a full path to the file.
A file path that <i>doesn't</i> start with a slash will have prepended to it 
the preceeding file path folder (up to but exluding the file name) 
that <i>did</i> start with a path.
If the first file doesn't start with a slash (as is normal),
its "prefix" will be <code>dde_apps_dir</code>
This scheme makes it easy to load multiple files in a folder since you only
have to include that folder name once.
<p/>
load_files returns the result of evaluating the last expression in the last file loaded.
</details> <!-- end load_files  -->

<details id="write_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>write_file</summary>
   Arguments:<br/>
   <b>filepath</b> The location to save to. This string must be the filepath for one of the 500 most recent files
     that you manually brought into the editor. It will overwrite the current content.
     Defaults to the file currently in the
     editor.<br/>
   <b>content</b> A string of the content you wish to be in the written file.
     Defaults to the text currently in the editor.<br/>
   Examples: <br/>
     <code>write_file()</code> Saves the content now in the editor to the file being edited.<br/>
     <code>write_file("no_exist.js")</code> This will error because write_file can't be used to create new files.<br/>
     <code>write_file("exists_but_not_edited.js")</code> This will error because write_file won't work
        unless the file is among the last 500 that you have edited.<br/>
     <code>write_file("foo.js")</code> Providing that foo.js has been edited by you,
        it will now contain the contents of the editor. 
        This is the <i>save_as</i> functionality.<br/>
     <code>write_file("/a_folder/foo.js", "new content")</code> Replaces the existing content
         of the given file with "new content".<br/>
</details>

<details id="folder_listing_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>folder_listing</summary>
  <code>folder_listing</code> retrieves an array of filenames and/or folder names that are somewhere
      beneath the <b>dde_apps</b> folder. This function only works if you have
      <i>Web Server for Chrome</i> installed. (See the doc for <b>load_files</b>.)<br/>
  Arguments:<br/>
  <b>folder</b> Default: <code>"/"</code>. The name of the folder to retreive the listing of.
            A folder of "/" finds the files and/or folders immediately below the <b>dde_apps</b> folder.
            Folder should begin and end with a slash, but if it doesn't, it will be added.<br/>
  <b>include_folders</b> Default: <code>true</code>. Retrieved folder names end in slash.<br/>
  <b>include_files</b> Default: <code>true</code>.<br/>
  <b>callback</b> Default: <code>out</code> A function of one argument. It is passed the
      array of file and/or folder names determined by the other arguments.<br/>
  Examples:<br/>
  <code>folder_listing()</code> Retrieves the files and folders immediately under <code>dde_apps</code>.<br/>
  <code>folder_listing("/test_folder/", true, false)</code> Retrieves only the folder names immediately under <code>test_folder</code>.<br/>
  <code>folder_listing("/whatever/", false, false)</code> Retrieves nothing. An empty array will be passed to the callback.

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Persistent Database</summary>
DDE has a very simple database, whose values remain in tact accross DDE sessions.
The DB stores a JSON object. The top level is a literal object
with string keys and values that can be any JSON objects, including null, booleans,
numbers, strings, arrays and other literal objects nested as deep as you like.
It is not meant to store a large amount of data, mostly preferences and
small objects. 
<p/>
The DB is stored in the file <code>dde_apps/persistent.json</code> as plain text.
You can view the entire by opening it in DDE's editor if you like.
However, we do not recommend editing it from DDE. That's because
any changes will be overwritten the next time something is written
to the DB by DDE. If you'd like to edit it as a file,
close DDE and edit it with another editor. Be careful to
get the JSON syntax correct.

<details id="persistent_set_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>persistent_set</summary>
Binds a literal to a string key that can be retreived in a later DDE session.
Null, booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and literal objects can all be stored.<br/>
<b>Example:</b> <code> persistent_set("test4", 44)</code>
</details>

<details id="persistent_get_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>persistent_get</summary>
Retreives a literal that was set with <code>persistent_set</code>
The first argument is the key to retreive. Its default value is <code>"get_all"</code>
which gets a JavaScript literal object that has key-value pairs for all the 
calls to <code>persistent_set</code>. If a key is not in the database,
<code>undefined</code> will be retreived.
<p/>
The 2nd arg is a callback that is passed the retreived value.
Its default value is the DDE function <code>out</code>.<br/>
<b>Example:</b> <code> persistent_get("test4", function(val){ out("Got: " + val)})</code>
</details> <!-- end persistent_get -->

<details id="persistent_remove_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>persistent_remove</summary>
Removes the binding between the first argument (key) and a stored value in the persistent db.<br/>
<b>Example:</b> <code> persistent_remove("test4")</code><br/>
After such a call, attempting to retreive the value of that key will get <code>undefined</code>.
</details>

<details id="persistent_clear_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>persistent_clear</summary>
Removes all the values in the persistent db.<br/>
<b>Example:</b> <code> persistent_clear()</code><br/>
After such a call, attempting to retreive the value of any key will get <code>undefined</code>.
<b>Warning:</b> DDE uses the persistent db to store the keys of edited files. 
Clearing the db will mean that you must have the Web Server for Chrome installed until
you manually edit those files again. See the documentation for <b>Files</b>.

<details id='Job_doc_id' style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Job</summary>
A job contains a do_list of instructions that it feeds to a robot to make things.
The syntax of defining a job is:
<pre><code>new Job({name: "j1", 
         robot: new Dexter(), 
         do_list: [ Dexter.move_to([200000, 200000, 50000]),
                    Robot.wait_until(1000)
                    ...
                   ]
        })</code></pre>
Defined jobs remain inert until they are started like so:<br/>
<code>Job.j1.start()</code><br/>
<code>start</code> initializes the job and feeds the instructions in its do_list to
the job's robot, which executes the instructions. Jobs either run to completion,
error, or are stopped by the user via <button>Jobs&#9660;</button> menu <b>Stop all jobs</b>.
Stopped jobs may be restarted by calling <code>Job.j1.start()</code> again.
This reinitializes the job with the original arguments passed to <code>new Job</code>
and runs the do_list instructions again. 

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>new Job parameters</summary>
The parameters used to define a new Job are:
    <ol><li><b>name</b> You can use <code>Job.a_job_name</code> to get the instance programmatically.</li>
        <li><b>robot</b> An instance of one of the subclasses of <code>Robot</code>, such as
            <code>Dexter</code>, designating where
            this Job's instructions are sent.</li>
        <li><b>do_list</b> An array of instructions to be sent to the job's robot when the
             Job is run. There are a number of different kinds of instructions, including
             user-defined JavaScript functions that can call arbitrary JS code.
             Instructions may add additional instructions to the do_list by returning
             them as a single instruction or an array of instructions.
             Such instructions are inserted into the do_list just below the instruction that 
             made them.
             <p/>Instructions are documented with the kind of robot that they run on.
        </li>
        <li><b>keep_history</b> true or false, default true. If true, the robot_status arrays
            returned from running instructions on the robot
            are stored in <code>Job.the_job_name.rs_history</code>.
            This is useful for debugging, but uses memory, which can be
            saved by setting keep_history to <code>false</code>.</li>
        <li><b>log_instructions</b> true or false, default false. Prints messages 
           to the Chrome console indicating the progress of a running job.</li>
        <li><b>inter_do_item_dur</b> A number indicating the number of milliseconds between
           when an instruction is completed by its robot, and when the next instruction is
           computed and sent to the robot of the job. This "taking a breath" gives other
           jobs a chance to run. Default 100.</li>
        <li><b>user_data</b> A literal object of name-value pairs where arbitrary data created
           at the beginning of a job or during the execution of an instruction can be stored
           and retrieved. Default <code>{}</code> (an empty object).
           It can be initialized in the call to new job like so:<br/>
           <code>new Job ({name:"j22" user_data:{color: "blue", weight: 123} })</code><br/>
           Within an instruction, you can get a user_data value via 
           <br/><code>this.user_data.color</code></br>
           or set it via<br/>
           <code>this.user_data.color = "green"</code></br>
           You can set existing user_data names or create new ones by setting them.
           <p/>
           user_data is persistent only while a job is executing. If you restart the
           job, its user_data is lost. For data that you want to persist across restarts,
           or for user_data that doesn't really belong with any one job but is used
           by mulitple ones, use the <i>class</i> property <code>Job.global_user_data</code>.
           This can be written to like so: <code>Job.global_user_data.my_count = 123</code>.
           <p/>
           The value for user_data is passed in when creating a job is shallow_copied when
           the job starts. So if this value was stored in some external-to-the-job way
           and a job is run twice with that very same user_data, the 2nd time the job

           However, if there is a mutable value (say an element of an array or a literal object,
           the first job might have modified that and that modification will be see
           when the job is run a 2nd time. Mostly all this doesn't matter because
           most jobs don't use user_data at all. Others look at it but don't
           write to it, and most of the others would only write top level, immutable
           values to it. But nested mutable data in user_data can "leak" over to
           another running of a job, or even other jobs. This might or might not
           be what you want.

<details id="start_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>start</summary>
   <code>start</code> is an instance method on <code>Job</code> that
   causes the job instance to feed its do_list to the Job's robot instance.
   After a job instance is done running, you can call <code>start</code>
   again to run it again.<p/>
   <i>Example</i> <code>Job.my_job.start()</code><p/>
   <i>Parameter</i><br/>
   <code>sent_from_job</code> can be any do_list item, which will be prepended to the do_list
         of the job before it is started. This new do_list item is <i>not</i> remembered
         in subsequent calls to start for this same job instance.
         It is thus a way to customize a job for each <code>start</code> call.
         <p/>
         Its name comes from its (interal) usage when the instruction <code>send_to_job</code>
         sends an instruction to a job that has been defined but not yet started.<p/>
         This parameter is not commonly used. Most users can ignore it.

  A robot is a machine that can execute the instructions in its instruction set. In general,
  each kind of robot will have its own instruction set. The primary
  difference between robots is the difference in their instruction sets.

These instructions can be used for any robot, as can the instructions for
the Human robot.

<details id="Robot.error_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>error</summary>
  Causes the job to error, immediately stopping it.
  The one argument is a string of a reason for the error which

  Robot.error("fubar")</pre>
</details>

<details id="Robot.get_page_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>get_page</summary>
  Similar to the function <code>get_page</code>, only made into an instruction.
  This instruction gets the content of a url and places it in a given user_data variable
  on the job instance before allowing the next instruction in the do_list to run.<br/>
  Example:<pre> new Job({name: "j1",
         do_list: [Robot.get_page("http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/acromine/dictionary.py?sf=BMI"),
                   function(){out("got response of: " +

         ]}) </pre>
  <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>url_or_options</b>: The url whose contents this instruction gets.<br/>
    Instead of a url as the argument, you can pass a literal JS object with lots of options, described at:
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">options</a>
    <p/>
  <b>response_variable_name</b>: Default: <code>"http_response"</code>. The name
     of the property in the job instance's user_data object to set to the
     content of the url.
  <p/>
Using <code>make_url</code> can help make constructing calls to <code>get_page</code> a bit easier.

   instance field <code>robot_status</code>. <p/>
   <code>grab_robot_status</code> provides an easy way to get values out of that array.
   <i>Parameters</i><br/>
   <b>user_data_variable</b> A string (required) of the name of the job's 
                          <code>user_data</code> variable to shove the grabbed

   <b>start_index</b> A non-negative integer signifying the
                 first data item to extract from the robot_status array.
                 Its default value is the value of <code>Serial.DATA0</code><br/>
                 <i>Special values:</i> <code>"all"</code> The entire 60 element robot_status
                 array is used. The value of end_index is ignored.<br/>
                 <code>"data_array"</code> The part of the robot_status array after 
                  the header information is used. For Serial robots, this will be just
                  the data returned by the serial port. For Dexter robots, this
                  will be the data about Dexter's joint angles, etc. 
                  The value of end_index is ignored.<br/>
    <b>end_index</b> A non-negative integer signifying the last element of the
                  robot_status array to extract. The default value is <code>null</code>.
                  If this value is null or not passed, only the data at the start_index
                  is used. The value will NOT be an array, just that one element.<br/>
                  <i>Special value</i> <code>"end"</code> The portion of the robot_status
                  from start_index through the end of the robot_status array is extracted.
                  <p/>
                  If both the start_index and end_index are not passed,
                  then the value will be: For a Serial robot, the first "item"
                  returned from the serial port in response to a send.
                  For Dexter, it will be DMA_READ_DATA.
                  <p/>                     
    You can use some constants for the values of start_index and end_index.<br/>
    For a Dexter robot these are: <pre>

In order to insure that the Dexter robot_status array is up to date,
you should place <code>Dexter.get_robot_status()</code> in your do_list before
the grab_robot_status instruction.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code>
Dexter.get_robot_status(),
Robot.grab_robot_status("no_result", Serial.DATA0), </code><br/>
See Job Example 9 for an extended example.

<details id="Robot.out_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>out</summary>
  Very similar to the function <code>out</code> but made for use as a robot instruction.
  Prints a message to the Output pane in the color of your choice.<p/>
  <i>Example:</i><br/>
  <code>Robot.out("hey " + 345, "green")</code><p/>
  <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>val</b> Any JavaScript data. Most commonly this is a string, but
             can be a number, an array etc.<br/>
  <b>color</b> A string representing a color. Default "black". Can
             be any string in the <b>color</b> series, or have the format:<br/>
             <code>"rgb(255, 100, 0)"</code>.
  <p/>
  This is the most basic debugging tool, often used to let you know that 
  the job its in has reached this instruction. Unlike an instruction such as:<br/>
  <code>function(){out("The status is: " + this.status_code)}</code><br/>
  Robot.out cannot access its job instance, but it does print out
  its job name and instruction ID right before printing <code>val</code>.
</details>

<details id="Robot.if_any_errors_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>if_any_error</summary>
  <code>if_any_error</code> checks to see if any of the supplied jobs have errored.
  If so, it inserts the supplied instruction into the do_list on the job
  that this instruction is on. In either case, <code>if_any_error</code> continues
  the job that its on.
  <i>Parameters</i><br/>
  <b>job_names</b> An array of strings of job names. If a named job doesn't exist, error.<br/>
  <b>instruction_if_error</b> An instruction that will be inserted into the do_list
  immediately after this instruction IF one of the named jobs has errored.
  The default for <code>instruction_if_error</code> is a function that
  inserts an instance of Robot.error into the do_list of this job, causing it to error.
  The "reason" for that error instruction is explicit about the cause of the error.
  <p/>
  Generally a job should be stopped quickly if there is an error. 
  This instruction makes it easy to stop jobs that are concurrently cooperating
  with the current job. The instruction_if_error can be a function (called with the
  current job for "this") so that some arbitrary compensation can be made for the error. 
</details>


<details id="Robot.stop_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>stop</summary>
  Causes the job to stop. This is an expected stop, as constrasted with
  <b>Robot.error</b>.
  The one argument is a string of a reason for stopping which
  will aid in debugging. Example:<pre>
  Robot.stop("all done")</pre>
</details>

<details id="Robot.suspend_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>suspend</summary>
  Causes the job to pause. It will not execute any more of its instructions 
  until it is unsuspended. It takes no arguments.
  Example:<code>Robot.suspend()</code>.
  <p/>
  <b>unsuspend</b> is a method on a job.<br/> 
  Example:<code>Job.my_job.unsuspend()</code>.
  This causes the job to resume from a suspension. You can call it
  from any JavaScript code such as in a function that's a do_list item.
  A job cannot unsuspend itself.
</details>

<details id="Robot.sync_point_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>sync_point</summary>
  A sync_point instruction cases all running jobs with the same-named sync_point
  to pause until they all reach the sync_point. Once that happens, they
  are all allowed to proceed executing their instructions.<br/>
  <i>Parameters</i><br/>
  <b>name</b> The name of the sync point. Must be identical with other sync points
              that you expect to be in-sync. There should only be one sync_point
              with a given name in a job.<br/>
  <b>job_names</b> An array of job names containing same_named sync points that
    you want to all pause at the same place. A sync_point instruction may
    contain the name of the job its in. Effectly that doesn't matter,
    but does allow all the same-named sync points to have the same list of job_names.<br/>
    Example: <code>Robot.sync_point("midway", ["job_one", "job_two"])</code><br/>
   <p/>
   If a sync point instruction has no job names, or only its own job name,
   it will not wait but rather breeze right through its sync_point.
   send_to_job can use such "labels" as marking insertion points for its
   new instructions via the parameter where_to_insert.
   <p/>
   By having different job_names, you can configure a sync_point in one job
   to wait for the other job's sync point to be reached, yet <i>not</i> have
   the other job wait for the first job. Any combination of such lop-sided
   waits can be set up amongst jobs with same-named sync_points for
   a lot of flexibility. This can increase the overall speed of a cooperating
   robot group over merely "all pause at each same-named sync_points" 
   because it allows those jobs that <i>can</i> proceed to do so.
</details>

<details id="Robot.send_to_job_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>send_to_job</summary>
<code>send_to_job</code> inserts instructions into another job's do_list. It can also
start, unsuspend and grab data from another job. <code>send_to_job</code> is complex, powerful,
and rarely used. Example: <pre>
Robot.send_to_job({to_job_name: "j4",
                   do_list_item: Dexter.move_to([100000, 100000, 100000]),
                   where_to_insert: "after_pc",
                   unsuspend: true,
                   wait_until_done: true})</pre>
<i>Parameters:</i><ul>
<li><b>to_job_name</b> The name of the job receiving the new instructions.</li>
<li><b>do_list_item</b> An instruction or array of instructions to insert into the to_job.</li> 
<li><b>where_to_insert</b> The location in the do_list of the to_job to insert the do_list_item.
  Such locations are always after the current program counter of to_job.
  This must be one of: 
  <ul><li><b><code>"next_top_level"</code></b> (the default). Inserts the do_list_item
  after the program_counter and just before the next original do_list item.
  If a function do_list item in to_job returns an array of instructions,
  this ensures that the inserted do_list_item will not go in the middle of such instructions.
  Thus if the instructions from the function must be executed as a continuous group, 
  "next_top_level" is a safe place to insert additional do_list items.</li>
    </li>
    <li><b><code>"after_pc"</code></b> Immediately after the to_job's program_counter. Not as safe as "next_top_level".</li>
    <li><b><code>"end"</code></b> At the very end of the do_list.</li>
    <li><b>sync_point name</b> Immediately after the sync_point that is after the program_counter
         and has this name. Note that you can have in the to_job do_list a sync_point instructions
         with no jobs to sync to. In that case, the sync_point is a harmless label for a location
         that can be used by send_to_job.</li>
    </ul></li>
 <li><b>wait_until_done</b> (default false) If true, the from_job will wait until the to_job
    executes its newly inserted instructions.</li> 
 <li><b>start</b> (default false) If true, and the to_job has yet to be started,
    it will be started after the do_list_item is inserted into its do_list.</li> 
 <li><b>unsuspend</b> (default false) If true, and the to_job is suspended,
     the to_job will be unsuspended after the do_list_item is inserted into its do_list.</li> 
 <li><b>status_variable_name</b> The name of a field placed in the user_data of the from_job.
     It is initialized to <code>"sent"</code>. When the inserted do_list_item has been executed,
     this field is set to <code>"done"</code>. </li> 
  <li><b>other variable names</b> If a parameter to send_to_job is not one of the above,
    it is assumed to be the name of a field to create in the user_data of the to_job.
    "Other variable names" have a value of a function. After the do_list_item is executed,
    the function for each of the other varible names is called within the to_job and
    the returned value is set to its corresponding other variable name in the 
    user_data of the from_job. This allows the from_job to get data from the to_job
    immediately after the do_list_item is run. </li>
 </ul>  
</details> <!-- end send_to_job -->

<details id="Robot.sent_from_job_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>sent_from_job</summary>
This instruction is typically not created by users directly. send_to_job creates
such an instruction and places it on the to_job as a container for the newly inserted
instructions. However, if you want to extend the do_list of a job when starting it,
you can pass an instance of <code>sent_from_job</code> as an option
of start. This will insert the new instruction(s) just before the job is started.
Example:<pre>Job.j8.start({sent_from_job: Robot.sent_from_job(
          {do_list_item: function(){out("special insert")},
           where_to_insert: "sp1"})})
</pre>
<b>do_list_item</b> can be a single instruction or an array of instructions.<br/>
<b>where_to_insert</b> See doc for send_to_job<br/>
The inserted instructions will not be present if, after running the job,
you call start with no argument.
</details> <!-- end sent_from_job -->

<details id="Robot.wait_until_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>wait_until</summary>
This instruction causes a job to pause until the supplied condition is met.<br/>
Example:<code>Robot.wait_until(1000)</code><br/>
The one argument can be:
<ul><li><b>an integer</b> The number of milliseconds for the wait. </li>
    <li><b>an instance of Duration</b> The amount of time to wait. Takes numerical arguments
    of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.<br/>
    Example:<code>new Duration(1, 59, 30, 500)</code><br/>
    This causes a pause of 1 hour, 59 minutes, 30 seconds and 500 milliseconds.       
    </li>
    <li><b>an instance of Date</b> Causes a wait until the JavaScript date occurs. 
         Careful, you can easily cause a job to wait for years!</li>
    <li><b>a function</b> The function is called at each do_loop iteration.
          The function's return value is used in a JavaScript <code>if</code> statement.
          false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, or the empty string ("") are considered to be false.
          Anything else is considered to be true and the wait will be over.
          The function is called with a <code>this</code> of the current job,
          so you can access the entire job's state when determining whether
          or not to return <code>true</code>.

<details id="Dexter_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Dexter</summary>
<b>Dexter</b> Dexter can perform instructions that command it to move. After it does
an instruction, it sends back information from its sensors confirming where it has moved
and additional data. This data can be used in subsequent instructions to both verify
Dexter's position as well as respond to forces on the arm and other sensor data.
<p/>
An instance of Dexter is created like so:
<pre><code>new Dexter({name: "my_dex",
            simulate: true
           })</code></pre>
<p/>
Multiple jobs may use a given robot instance as their robot. It is up to the programmer

active robot with the same name or ip_address.
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>new Dexter parameters</summary>
The parameters used to define an instance of Dexter are:
<ul>
    <li><b>name</b> Any string, but must be unique across all robots.
    The instance of the robot is stored in <code>Robot.the_name</code></li>
    <li><b>simulate</b> true or false, default true.
    If simulate is <code>true</code>, instructions will not be sent to the robot, but rather
    simulated in software, fully under DDE's control. If simulate is <code>false</code>,
    the instructions will be sent to the Dexter at the given ip_address.
    </li>
    <li><b>ip_address</b> A string of an ip_address such as: <code>"192.168.1.1"</code>
        Default null. You can use a Dexter without an ip_address, but only with <code>simulate: true</code></li>
    <li><b>port</b> An integer. Default 5000. </li>
    <li><b>base_xyz</b> An array of three numbers.
           Indicates the position of Dexter on its table in microns. Default: <code>[0, 0, 0]</code></li>
    <li><b>base_plane</b> Indicates the plane of Dexter. The default: <code>[0, 0, 0]</code> 
       means that Dexter is standing vertically on a horizontal table surface.</li>
    <li><b>base_rotation</b> A number of arc-seconds. 
           The rotation of Dexter's base on the base_plane. Default <code>0</code>.</li>
    <li><b>enable_heartbeat</b> A Dexter instance sends a "heartbeat" to a Dexter robot to
      keep the connection alive. If true, the default, that heartbeat will be sent.</li>

<details id="Dexter.draw_dxf_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>draw_dxf</summary>
    This instruction accepts the name of a file as input and creates additional instructions
    to move Dexter to "draw the lines" indicated by the dxf file.
    <ul><li><b>filepath</b> A string representing the name of the dxf file under the <b>dde_apps</b> folder
        containing the dxf instructions. The file can be directly under dde_apps or
        nested in subfolders of any depth.
        <p/>
        The filepath is usually a string that ends in <code>.dxf</code> or
        <code>.DXF</code> If it does not and is more than 512 characters long, it
        will be assumed to be a string of actual dxf code.
        </li>
    <li><b>scale</b></li> dxf files indicate line endpoint positions as dimensionless units.
       DDE requires the x,y,z positions to be in microns. <code>scale</code> converts
       the dxf positions to microns. If scale is a number, it multiplies the dxf
       positions by that number. The default for scale is 1, meaning no transformation.
       If the dxf positions are intended to be in millimeters, use 1000 for scale.
       <p/>
       Scale can also be a string representing a scale factor.

<details id="Dexter.empty_instruction_queue_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>empty_instruction_queue</summary>
<i>Parameters:</i> None.<br/>
A Dexter robot has an <i>instruction queue</i> which contains instructions that have been sent from
DDE but not yet executed. As soon as Dexter recieves an instruction from DDE, it typically acknowledges receipt
to DDE,
which causes DDE to send the next instruction in the Job's do_list.
An <code>empty_instruction_queue</code> instruction changes that behavior and causes all the instructions in the
queue to be executed before DDE attempts to run another instruction on the do_list.
</details> <!-- end empty_instruction_queue -->

<details id="Dexter.empty_instruction_immediately_queue_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>empty_instruction_queue_immediately</summary>
<i>Parameters:</i> None.<br/>
A Dexter robot has an <i>instruction queue</i> which contains instructions that have been sent from
DDE but not yet executed. As soon as Dexter recieves an instruction from DDE, it typically acknowledges receipt
to DDE,
which causes DDE to send the next instruction in the Job's do_list.
An <code>empty_instruction_queue_immediately</code> instruction removes all the 
instructions from the instruction queue
without executing them. It then informs DDE to send the next instruction.
This is an unusual instruction as it implies that the instructions sent to Dexter were in error.
You might want to do this in an emergency situation or if the environment unexpectedly changes.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.get_robot_status_queue_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>get_robot_status</summary>
<i>Paramenters:</i> None<br/>
Retrieves lots of information from Dexter. This is placed in an array that becomes the value of
the job's <code>robot_status</code> field, and, if the job's <code>keep_history</code> is true, gets pushed onto the 
job's <code>rs_history</code> array.
<p/>
This instruction blocks further processing of the job's do_list instructions until
all of the instructions on Dexter's instruction_queue are executed.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.get_robot_status_immediately_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>get_robot_status_immediately</summary>
<i>Paramenters:</i> None<br/>
Retrieves lots of information from Dexter. This is placed in an array that becomes the value of
the job's <code>robot_status</code> field, but is not placed on the job's <code>rs_history</code> array.
<p/>
Unlike <code>get_robot_status</code>, this instruction causes Dexter to return its data immediately,
before any of the instructions on its <i>instruction queue</i> are executed.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_to_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>move_to</summary>
This instruction commands Dexter to move from whereever it is, to position its
end effector at the given x, y, z location. It is complicated by the fact that
usually there is more than one configuration of Dexter's joints that
can achieve that position and that Dexter is inherently limited by the
lengths of its links. 
<i>Parameters</i><br/>
<b>xyz</b> tells Dexter to position its end effector to a position.
An array of 3 numbers, each indicating microns from the position 0, 0, 0
which is at the center of the base of Dexter, in its surface (think table) plane.
Imagine yourself as Dexter facing forwards. The x-axis is to your left and right
with left being negative and right being positive. The valid range is
-747804 to 747804. The Y axis runs from behind you to in front of you with
negative behind you and positive in front ranging from -747804 to 747804.
The z axis is vertical with below the table being negative and above the
table ranging from -582704 to 912904 with 0 being at the table surface.
Note that not all of the x,y,z combinations are reachable by Dexter. 
If Dexter is on a table, then none of the negative y values are reachable,
since they are below the table.
The J5_direction parameter also affects reachability.
<p/>
<b>J5_direction</b> indicates the direction you want the end effector to be pointing.
This is an array of 3 numbers (each ranging from -1 to 1)
that you can think of as indicating a "point" off
of the end of the end effector. The default is [0, 0, -1] which
causes the end effector to point straight down. {needs work}
<p/>
<b>config</b> For most points within the reachability of Dexter, there are multiple
ways in which Dexter can get there. config helps you specify your preference
as to <i>how</i> Dexter configures its joints to get to the indicated x, y, z.
There are 3 independent boolean values to determining this configuration.
They are: <ul>
<li><i>base-rotation</i> <code>LEFT</code> means J1, the base joint has a negative value,
     ie it is to the right of facing front. Looking down from the top at Dexter this would
     mean its rotated counter clockwise. The opposite direction is <code>RIGHT</code>
     or clockwise.</li>
<li><i>J3-position</i> Joint 3 can be thought of as Dexter's elbow. The elbow can be either
      <code>UP</code> i.e. away from the table or <code>DOWN</code>, closer to the table./li>
<li><i>J4 Position</i> Joint 4 can be thought of as Dexter's wrist. It can be pointing either
    <code>IN</code>, towards the base, or <code>OUT</code>, away from the base.</li>
</ul>
Config is most easily specified using one of 26 constants such as:
<code>Dexter.LEFT_DOWN_IN</code> or <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP_OUT</code>. You can omit 1 or 2 of these value as in
<code>Dexter.LEFT_IN</code>  or <code>Dexer.OUT</code>. The complete list is:<pre>
Dexter.LEFT            = [0, null, null]
Dexter.LEFT_DOWN       = [0, 0,    null]
Dexter.LEFT_UP         = [0, 1,    null]
Dexter.LEFT_IN         = [0, null, 0]
Dexter.LEFT_OUT        = [0, null, 1]
Dexter.LEFT_DOWN_IN    = [0, 0,    0]
Dexter.LEFT_DOWN_OUT   = [0, 0,    1]
Dexter.LEFT_UP_IN      = [0, 1,    0]
Dexter.LEFT_UP_OUT     = [0, 1,    1]

Dexter.RIGHT           = [1, null, null]
Dexter.RIGHT_DOWN      = [1, 0,    null]
Dexter.RIGHT_UP        = [1, 1,    null]
Dexter.RIGHT_IN        = [1, null, 0]
Dexter.RIGHT_OUT       = [1, null, 1]
Dexter.RIGHT_DOWN_IN   = [1, 0,    0]
Dexter.RIGHT_DOWN_OUT  = [1, 0,    1]
Dexter.RIGHT_UP_IN     = [1, 1,    0]
Dexter.RIGHT_UP_OUT    = [1, 1,    1]

Dexter.DOWN            = [null, 0, null]
Dexter.DOWN_IN         = [null, 0, 0]
Dexter.DOWN_OUT        = [null, 0, 1]
Dexter.UP              = [null, 1, null]
Dexter.UP_IN           = [null, 1, 0]
Dexter.UP_OUT          = [null, 1, 1]</pre>
The above list is in the series <b>Robot/robot config</b>.
Not mentioning a boolean (null) means "don't care", ie let DDE figure it out. Since config limits
the possible options, some configurations will be impossible with some xyz settings and/or
J5_direction settings. Impossible settings cause an error.

<details id="Dexter.move_to_relative_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>move_to_relative</summary>
This function is the same as <code>Dexter.move_to</code> except that the xyz values are ADDED to Dexter's
existing end effector xyz values, not taken as absolutes.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_all_joints_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>move_all_joints</summary>
move_all_joints is a lower level instruction than move_to, giving you the ability to dicate
the angle of each of Dexter's 5 joints, J1 through J5. A joint's angle is specified in arc_seconds. 
(There are 3600 arc_seconds per degree and 648,000 per 180 degrees.)
The min and max angles of each joint are in constants: <code>Dexter.J1_ANGLE_MIN</code> 
through <code>Dexter.J5_ANGLE_MAX</code>, all included in the series <b>Dexter_constant</b>. 
Examples:<br/>
<code>Dexter.move_all_joints(10000, null, 30000)</code><br/>
<code>Dexter.move_all_joints([10000, null, 30000])</code><br/>
Both of these have the same function, i.e. you can pass in an array of up to 5 arc_seconds,
or you can pass in individual numbers.
<code>null</code> or the lack of enough numbers means keep the angle for that joint what it is at now.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_all_joints_relative_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>move_all_joints_relative</summary>
The same as Dexter.move_all_joints except that the given angles are added to the current
angles of the robot. <code>null</code> or missing angle increments default to 0.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_home_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>move_home</summary>
Moves all joints to 0. J1 is facing forwards, J2, J3, J4 are straight up. J5 
causes Link 5 to be horizontal pointing forwards.
Example: <code>Dexter.move_home()</code>
</details>

<details id="make_ins_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>make_ins</summary>
Normally you should make instructions for Dexter using one of the high level method calls,
ie <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code>. However, we provide the function <code>make_ins</code>,
useful in some low level situations. The first argument is the instruction type,
a single letter string such as "a". The remaining arguments are whatever that instruction type
accepts. Example:<br/>
<code>make_ins("a", 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5)</code> creates an instruction that moves the 5 joints 
by 1, through 5 respectively.
If you have the arguments in an array, you can use this syntax:<br/>
<code>make_ins("a", ...my_array)</code>
<p/>
The returned value is an array that has its first several fields empty. DDE uses them
for storing the job_id, instruction_id and some timing information.
</details> <!-- end make_ins -->

<details id="Dexter.run_gcode_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>run_gcode</summary>
This instruction accepts the name of a file as input and creates additional instructions 
to move Dexter to "draw the lines" indicated by the gcode file.
<ul><li><b>filepath</b> A string representing the name of the gcode file under the <b>dde_apps</b> folder
    containing the gcode instructions. The file can be directly under dde_apps or
    nested in subfolders of any depth. Typically the filepath will have an extension of <code>.gcode</code>
    but that isn't required by filepath.</li>
    <li><b>scale</b></li> gcode files indicate line endpoint positions as dimensionless units.
       DDE requires the x,y,z positions to be in microns. <code>scale</code> converts
       the gcode positions to microns. If scale is a number, it multiplies the gcode
       positions by that number. The default for scale is 1, meaning no transformation.
       If the gcode positions are intended to be in millimeters, use 1000 for scale.
       <p/>
       Scale can also be a string representing a scale factor.

    <code>run_gcode</code> is similar to <code>draw_dxf</code>. <code>run_gcode</code> only handles G0 and G1 instructions,
    and only their X, Y, and Z arguments.
    It treats G0 and G1 the same.
    <code>run_gcode</code> needs lots of work.

<b>Human</b> is a "robot" that is commanded to do things via pop up dialog boxes.
Examples of its instructions are <code>Human.task</code>, and <code>Human.enter_number</code>.
When a human instruction is run, a dialog box is shown and the job waits for a user to
enter some information and click on a button to either cancel the job (and dependent jobs)
or proceed.
<p/>
Human instructions are a way to encode tasks that Dexter can't do or information
that it can't know. The inclusion of human instructions in DDE permits the design and
running of jobs that need coodination between humans and machines.
<p/>
Although the "home" of human instructions is in the <i>Human</i> robot, you can use
these instructions in a job with <i>any</i> robot. They do not attempt to
access robot hardware.
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Human Instructions</summary>
<details id="Human.task_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>task</summary>

  next instruction in its do_list. A <button>Stop this & dependent jobs</button> button is
  also presented. If clicked, this job and its dependent jobs are stopped.<p/>
  <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>task</b> Default: "". A string that will appear in the body of the dialog box. It is intended
     as an English instruction to the human reading it. When the human has completed

  See <b>Human.task</b> for behavior common to all Human instructions,
  but unlike other Human instructions, <b>notify</b> does not have a <b>user_data_variable_name</b> parameter,
  nor do its dialog boxes have buttons.
  It also does not wait for a user action before allowing its job to continue to the next do_list item.<p/>
  <i>Uncommon Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>window</b> true or false, default: true. Whether or not to present the information in a window.<br/>
  <b>output_pane</b> true or false, default: true. Whether or not to present the task in the output pane.<br/>
  <b>beep_count</b> Non-negative integer, default: 0. How many beep 'alerts' to sound when
                   this instruction is run.<br/>
  <b>speak</b> true or false, default: false. Whether or not to speak the title and task when this
         instruction is run.

<details id="Serial_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Serial</summary>
<b>Serial</b> is not a specific robot per se, its a connection to another computer via its serial port.
This connection is very general. It knows nothing about the actual capabilities of what its
connected to, only that it can send and receive strings on its serial port.
<p/>
DDE's Serial robot is quite similar to Dexter from DDE's perspective. It
can be sent instructions from a Job's do_list and its output is interpreted as
a "robot_status" similarly to Dexter's robot_status. The Serial robot has been
used to connect to Arduino boards via its USB connector, and should work with Raspberry Pi and other
similar devices.

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Arduino</summary>
In order for the serial port connection to work with Arduino, you need to have
the Arduino IDE installed. Its a free and easy download from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc">https://www.arduino.cc</a>
<p/>If you don't get a connection, sometimes unplugging and replugging the 
USB cable will help. You can also try relaunching DDE.
Another debugging techinque is using the Arduino IDE's menubar/Tools/Serial Monitor.
The upper type in area is for a string that you want to send to the board.
The lower area displays strings coming back from the board.
</details>

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Arduino and Mac</summary>
Beware: It appears that Arduino plays poorly with Macintosh computers.
We've been unsuccessful at connecting a Sparkfun RedBoard with Mac and
have heard of other problems between Arduino's Uno R3 boards. We've had success
with Arduino Leonardo and believe Arduino Micro will also work due to its
similar communication architecture. (Feb 2017) The Arduino Micro cannot
accomodate standard Arduino add-on (shield) boards but the Leonardo can.
</details> <!-- end Arduino and Mac-->

Create an instance of Serial similar to the other robots. Example: <br/>
<code>new Serial({name: "S1", ...})</code><p/>

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Parameters to new</summary>
<b>name</b> A string. Makes this instance of a Serial Robot accessible from Robot.the_name<br/>

<b>simulate</b> true or false. Default <code>true</code>. If true, no data is sent or recieved over
the actual serial port.<br/>

<b>sim_fun</b> A function. Default <code>return_first_arg</code>. Used only when <code>simulate: true</code><br/>
When a Serial.string.instruction is simulated, its argument, <code>instruction_string</code> is
passed to the sim_fun. The value returned from calling sim_fun is the simulated return value (a string)
from the serial port for this instruction. The function can use any JavaScript to compute
the returned string. <p/>
Consider the item_delimiter when making up this returned string. Often
the string should end in the item_delimiter, but it doesn't have to. <p/>
We're not expecting
the sim_fun to do exactly what the Serial hardware would do. In fact if it could,
there would be no need for the hardware! Rather sim_fun should perform as a diagnostic
for at least one case or perhaps a few cases of instruction strings.
The default value of <code>return_first_arg</code> just returns its input to help you verify that
the basic communication path is working.<br/>

<b>path</b> A string. Required. The label for the device connected to a serial port on the computer running DDE 
that you want this software robot to connect to.
Valid paths can be seen
by calling <code>serial_show_devices()</code>. On Windows, they look something like 
 <code>"COM3" </code>.
On Mac, they look something like <code>"/dev/tty.usbmodem1411"</code>. 
 In addition to the tty path, Mac's also have a "cu" path such as: <code>"/dev/cu.usbmodem1411"</code>.
 We've found both <code>tty</code> and <code>cu</code> paths to work with DDE.<br/>

<b>connect_options</b> A literal object. Default <code>{}</code>. <br/>
Example: <code>{baudRate: 9600}</code> <br/>
9600 is the default baudRate (which is the same as bitrate, i.e. bits per second). All options documented at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport#serialport-path-options-opencallback">https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport#serialport-path-options-opencallback</a><br/>

<b>capture_n_items</b> A non-negative integer. Default <code>1</code>.<br/>
DDE waits until it has recieved capture_n_items from the device before calling the next instruction on
the job's do_list. The string returned by the serial device is cut up by <code>item_delimiter</code>,
to determine the number of items returned by the serial device.
<br/>

<b>item_delimiter</b> A string. Default <code>"\\n"</code>. Note that Arduino's 
<code>Serial.println("foo")</code> will send out a 5 character string of <code>"foo\\r\\n"</code><br/>

<b>trim_whitespace</b> A boolean. Default <code>true</code>.
If this is true, then an "item" (string) returned by the serial port, will have the
whitespace at its beginning and end removed. Note that with the defaults in place
of an item_delimiter of <code>"\\n"</code>, and trim_whitespace of <code>true</code>,
then when Arduino executes: <code>Serial.println("hi")</code> the actual 4 characters
transmitted to DDE are: <code>hi\\r\\n</code>. It is recognized as one item because
it ends in the delimiter, giving us a 3 character item, except that the <code>trim_whitespace</code>
takes off that final <code>\\r</code> and we're left with <code>hi</code>, usually what you want.
<p/>
This arrangement gets around our society's failure to set one standard for the most important formatting
operation, breaking up of lines, with <code>\\n</code> being used by Unix and Mac, and
<code>\\r\\n</code> being used by Windows and Arduino. DDE tries to use the more
sensible <code>\\n</code> where possible. Thus <code>\\n</code> can be our
default item_delimiter and we still win calling Arduino's <code>Serial.println</code>.
<br/>

<b>parse_items</b> true or false. Default true. If true, the returned items will be converted from strings to
primitive JS data types: booleans, numbers, arrays, literal objects, strings, and aggrigates of such.
Example: In Arduino C, you could have a program that executes: 
<br/><code>Serial.println("[1, 20, 300]");</code><br/>
With <code>parse_items: true</code> that would result in DDE's robot_status array as an element of
an array of three integers.

<b>capture_extras</b> One of "error", "ignore" or "capture". Default "error". 
<ul><li><code>"error"</code> means that any extra data output by the board will cause an error, halting the current job.</li>
    <li><code>"capture"</code> means that extra output will be appended onto the end of the robot_status associated
        with the last instruction sent. Beware that such data won't be available as soon as the expected
        data of capture_n_items has been received.</li> 
     <li><code>"ignore"</code> means that any items after capture_n_items and before the next instruction sent will
        be thrown away, but will not cause an error.</li>
</ul>
<b>instruction_callback</b> A function that is called when a valid return value is received
to control what a job should do next. The default causes the next instruction in the Job's
do_list to be executed. Usually you won't want to change this.<br/>

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Serial Instructions</summary>
<details id="Serial.string_instruction_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>string_instruction</summary>
Has one argument, a string, which is sent the the Serial robot. 
If the argument is <i>not</i> a string, it is converted to one using <code>JSON.stringify</code> .
The functionality of that string is entirely dependent on how the device
you are sending it to, interprets it.<br/>
Example: <code>Serial.string_instruction(4.5)</code><br/>
sends the 3 character string: <code>"4.5"</code>  to the serial robot.<br/>
See Job Example 9 for an extended example.

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Debugging Serial</summary>
Due to the interplay between two different computers (the one running DDE and the Serial device)
and their entirely different software protocols, debugging Serial robot interfaces is challenging.
DDE provides a number of low level functions that can be invoked without interacting with a job
to help you verify connectivity.<p/>

<b id="serial_devices_doc_id"><code>serial_devices()</code></b> Returns an array of objects representing
the available devices on serial ports. the <code>comName</code> field holds the path to the serial
port that you can use to connect to that device. 
<p/>

<b id="serial_path_to_info_map_doc_id"><code>serial_path_to_info_map</code></b> Holds the mapping between the
<code>path</code> of a serial device and lots of properties about it, most of which come from defining
the associated Serial robot. The value of this global variable is a JS literal object with
keys of each path to which there is a serial connection, and values of
another JS literal object holding useful properties of that connection, i.e. its "info".<p/>
You can get the info for a path via <br/>
<code>serial_path_to_info_map[path]</code>
<p/>

<b id="serial_connect_low_level_doc_id"><code>serial_connect_low_level("/dev/tty.some_device")</code></b> 
Allows you to create a software connection between a serial device and DDE software NOT in a job.
<p/>

<b id="serial_send_low_level_doc_id"><code>serial_send_low_level( "some_path", "some_string")</code></b> 
Allows you to send a string to a serial device from DDE but NOT in a job.
<p/>

<b id="serial_disconnect_doc_id"><code>serial_disconnect("some_path")</code></b> Disconnects an existing connection. 
<p/>

<b id="serial_flush_doc_id"><code>serial_flush("some_path")</code></b> Removes all bytes in the given path's input and output buffers.

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Window System</summary>
Dealing with HTML, CSS and JavaScript of traditional web apps is complex.
DDE uses those technologies but with a simplied wrapper for them to help
users create interactive windows with the most needed features.

<details id="show_window_doc_id"style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>show_window</summary>
A call to <code>show_window</code> creates a dialog box using HTML and JavaScript. 
<i>Parameters</i><br/>
 <b>title</b> A string of the HTML displayed in the window's title bar. Default: "DDE Information"<br/>
 <b>width</b> The number of pixels wide that the window will be. Default: 400<br/>
 <b>height</b> The number of pixels tall that the window will be. Default: 400<br/>
 <b>x</b> The number of pixels that the left edge of the window will be from the left edge of the DDE window.
          Default: 200<br/>
 <b>y</b> The number of pixels that the top edge of the window will be from the top edge of the DDE window.
          Default: 200<br/>
 <b>content</b> HTML to be rendered in the body of the window. input tags with <code>type</code>
    attributes of <code>button</code> and <code>submit</code> will cause the window's
    callback function to be called. <code>submit</code> will also cause the window to be closed.<p/>
    HTML elements with a class of "clickable" will behave as a button. Clicking on them 
    will cause the window's callback button to be called with a <code>clicked_button_value</code>
    property of the <code>name</code>, or if none, the <code>id</code> of the clicked on element.
    Clicking on such HTML elements will <i>not</i> close the window.<br/>
    <i>Example</i>:<br/>
    <code>show_window({<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;content:'&lt;p id="p_id" class="clickable">some para&lt;/p>',<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callback: function (vals){ append_in_ui("p_id", "&lt;h1>hey&lt;/h1>")}<br/>
    })</code><br/>
 <b>callback</b> A function of one argument. It will be called when a the user clicks a button in
    a show_window. It's argument will be a literal object. Many of its fields are x and y positions
    reletive to the top-left of html elements in or containing the clicked position.
    An example:<br/><pre>
    {x: 300,           //relative to the parent of the elt clicked on
    y: 213,
    clientX: 300,      //relative to the content area (the viewport) of the browser window

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>SVG</summary>
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a way
to draw 2D graphics on a web page. The drawn elements
(circles, lines, etc.) are surrounded by a svg tag wrapper
indicating the size of the drawing area. You can use
svg tags directly in the content for a show_window.<p/>
The methods documented below create that html from JavaScript calls,
facilitating dynamic content creation as well as
making static svg shapes a little easier to create.<p/>
<i>Parameters for all svg functions</i>:<br/>
<b>id</b> The html id of the element, useful in calls to window utility functions
such as <code>append_in_ui</code>.<br/>
<b>html_class</b>: Used to set the <code>class</code> attrbute of the element.
Due to a name conflict with <code>class</code> in JavaScript, we had to name this
<code>html_class</code>.<br/>
<b>style</b>: A string setting the css style of the element. Note that some
arguments to svg functions are actually rendered as style attributes, such as
<code>color</code>, <code>border_color</code>, <code>border_width</code>.

<details id="svg_svg_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>svg_svg</summary>
svg shapes must be drawn as child elements of an <code>svg</code> element.
The x and y of those child elements is relative to the upper left corner of
the containing svg element. So for instance, if you draw a circle with
x: 0, y: 0, you will see only the lower right corner of the circle
in the upper left corner of the svg area.
<i>Parameters</i> <br/>
<b>width</b>:  Width  in pixels of the rectangle area to put svg shapes in.<br/>
<b>height</b>: Height in pixels of the rectangle area to put svg shapes in.<br/>
<b>viewBox</b>: A string of four space_separated numbers that controls the scale and positioning
                of the contained svg elements.<br/>
<b>child_elements</b>: Default: <code>[]</code>. An array of strings of the html for
   svg shapes. Usually these strings should be created with the svg shape creator functions
      such as <code>svg_circle</code>. <p/>
 <i>Example</i>:<pre> show_window({
   content:svg_svg({
       id:"s_id", width:500, height:200, 
       html_class:"clickable",
       child_elements: [

<details id="svg_html_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>svg_html</summary>
This renders arbitrary html at the location specified.
svg_html must be drawn as a child element of an <code>svg</code> element.<br/>
<i>Parameters</i> <br/>
<b>x</b>: Default: 0.  The x position of the upper left of the rendered HTML.<br/>

Unlike the other svg functions, <code>svg_html</code> does not take <code>id</code>, <code>class</code>
and <code>style</code> arguments. If you desire these, they must be placed on the individual
html tags within the value of the <code>html</code> argument. Note that
here we need to spell the class attribute by its correct HTML name, <code>class</code>,
not the special spelling used in the other svg functions of <code>html_class</code>.

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Object System</summary>
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Overview</summary>
An object system helps you organize data that can inherit from
other objects or classes. Most programming languages have a 
class-instance based object system. JavaScript's new class-based
object system is a mediocre class-instance object system.
But the original JavaScript object system is supposed to
be a "prototype" object system. Good prototype object systems
are simpler, more flexible and easier to learn than
class-instance object systems. However, JS's original object
system isn't a good prototype object system as demonstrated by
the numerous object system varients added on to JS, including
JS 6's class object system. 
<p/>
One of the problems with class-instance object systems is that
they force you to decide whether an object should be a class
or an instance. But sometimes you want to use a particular object
as both a class (to inherit from) and an instance (that
you can set instance variables in). You may also want to
"inhert" from an "instance". One of the most powerful
descriptive mechanisms in natural language is to say
something like "The chair I want is just like this one
except its blue." This is using an instance of a chair
to describe another instance of chair that inherits 
from the first instance. Class-instance object systems
don't allow you to do this, but good prototype object systems
and DDE's object system do.
<p/>
We've coerced JS's prototype object system into
a more useful one by adding some methods to JavaScript.
These new methods, in conjunction with existing JS functions,
give you a pretty good prototype object system.
<p/>
</details> <!-- overview -->

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>New Object System Methods</summary>
DDE augments JS with some new variables, functions and methods to
help you get the most value out of a prototype object system.

<details id="rootObject_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Root</summary> 
<code>Root</code> is a global constant that contains the root object of DDE's object system.
</details>

<details id="newObject_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>newObject</summary>
<code>newObject</code> let's you create a new object. It takes
literal objects as arguments, usually just one.
The properties of the arguments become the properties
of the new object. If two of the input objects have a same named property,
the property in the resulting object will have the value of the <i>last</i> argument.
There are three properties that behave 
specially.
<p/>
<b><i>prototype</i></b> This property sets the "parent" object
of the new object. <i>prototype</i> defaults to code>Root</code>. 
Once you have the new object, <code>new_obj.prototype</code> gives you
back that prototype. Unlike most other properties, you cannot set this property and win.
Class-instance object systems don't allow you to change the class of an object.
In practice, this usually isn't needed.
<p/>
<b><i>name</i></b> This optional property gives the new object a "name"
property (as is normal), but it also creates a field in the prototype
object with the new name and a value of the new object. By doing this,
you have a path from the <code>Root</code> to this new object using the
object names from the top on down separated by dot.
The names immediately under the root object are global so
you can omit <code>Root</code> from such paths.
<p/>
You should only supply a name when calling newObject, and never set it.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<code>newObject({<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "vehicle",<br/> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: "white",<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight: 3000})<br/>
Root.vehicle => the new object<br/>
Root.vehicle.name => "name"<br/>
Root.vehicle.color => "white"</code><br/>
newObject({<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prototype: Root.vehicle,<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "boat",<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: "blue"})<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat => the new object<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat.name => "boat"<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat.color => "blue"<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat.weight => 3000 //inheited from vehicle<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat.color = "green"<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat.color => "green"<br/>
Root.vehicle.color => "white" // hasn't changed.<br/>
Root.vehicle.weight = 2000<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat.weight => 2000 //inherits the new value from vehicle
Root.vehicle.launch = function(){return "set sail"}<br/>
Root.vehicle.launch() => "set sail"<br/>
Root.vehicle.boat.launch() => "set sail"
<p/>
<b><i>constructor</i></b>
When creating an object, (or afterwards) you can set a property named 
<code>constructor</code> in the new object to a method. This method is called
whenever a new object is created with <code>newObject</code>.
Unlike its counterpart in JS6 classes, <code>constructor</code>
is called with no arguments. However, <code>this</code>
is our new object with all the fields populated from the properties
passed in the call to <code>newObject</code>, saving a ton of boiler plate code.
In the body of <code>constructor</code>, you can call any code you like,
including code that modifies the passed in property values, create
entirely new properties or remove ones from <code>this</code>.
<p/>
Example: <code>newObject({name: "animal", <br/>
 constructor: function(){ this.fur = "no"}}) <br/>
newObject({prototype: Root.animal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name: "fido"})</code>
<p/>
Above, during the first call to newObject, <code>this</code> is bound
to the <i>animal</i> object. But when the 2nd call to newObect is
made, the <code>this</code> in animal.constructor is bound to
the object in Root.animal.fido.<br/>
Here's the state of the relevant properties:<br/> 
<code>
Root.animal.fur => "no"<br/>
Root.animal.fido.fur => "no" <br/>
</code>
Each object has its own copy of the "fur" property.
Setting one will not set the other.
<p/>
JS6 class constructor methods can have a call to <code>super</code>.
It's counterpart in DDE is a method whose name makes sense:
<code>callPrototypeConstructor</code>, documented below.
</details>

<details id="callPrototypeConstructor_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>callPrototypeConstructor</summary>
When you have a hierarchy of objects, often you want an object low in the
hierarchy to be initialized similarly to ones higher up, but with
some modifications. Thus you'd have constructor on a "vehicle" object,
then another one on a sub-object, "boat". The boat object should
probably call the constructor for the vehicle object at the top
of the boat constructor, and then make additional modifications to
"this" in the bottom part of the boat constructor method.
<p/>
Example: <br/>
<code>newObject({name: "animal", 
           constructor: function(){ this.fur = "no"}})
newObject({prototype: Root.animal, name: "mammal",
  constructor: function(){<br/>
     this.callPrototypeConstructor()<br/>
     this.fur = "usually"<br/>
     this.hair = "sometimes"<br/>
  	 out("in mammal constructor")}})</code><br/>
After running the above code,<br/> 
<code>
Root.animal.fur => "no".<br/>
Root.animal.mammal.fur => "usually"<br/>
Root.animal.mammal.hair => "sometimes"<br/>
</code>
You don't <i>have to</i> call callPrototypeConstructor,
and even if you do, it doesn't have to be before
the lower level constructor function modifies <code>this</code>
though <i>usually</i> these are good practices.
</details>

<details id="Object.isNewObject_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>isNewObject</summary>
Returns true if the argument was created with newObject.
Examples:<br/><code>
Object.isNewObject({a:11}) => false<br/>
Object.isNewObject(newObject({name: "trash"})) => true<br/>
</code>
</details>
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>subObjects</summary>
Returns an array of the named subojects of <code>this</code><br/>
Example:<br/>
<code>Root.subObjects()</code> => array of the top level named new objects.
</details>

<details id="isSubObject_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>isSubObject</summary>
The primary relationship between objects in DDE's object system
is the prototype relationship. An object inherits properties from
its prototype. If you want an object to have  a different value
for a particular property than its prototype object does,
ust create a property in the object, and that will effectiely
"shadow" the prototype value and use the "local" value in the object
for that property. 
<p/>
An object always knows which object is its prototype. (All objects
have a prototype except Root.) But prototypes only know
what objects have them as their prototype if those other objects
are named, which is optional. 
By giving an object a name, you automatically install a property
in its prototype with a key of that name and a value of the object.
Now the prototype knows about its "children". We used the term subObject
to mean such named objects.
<p/>
With no argument, 
returns true if <code>this</code> is a named new object and that name is a
property in <code>this.prototype</code> with a value of this.<br/>
In other words: <code>this == this.prototype[this.name]</code>
Example:<br/><code>
newObject({prototype: Root, name: "junk"}).isSubObject() => true
</code><br/>
With an argument, the argument is the presumed prototype of this.
If the argument is this's prototype, and the prototype has a field in it named the same as this, 
and its value is this, then isSubObect returns true.<br/>
Example:<br/><code>
newObject({prototype: Root, name: "junk"}).isSubObject(Root) => true
</code><br/>
</details>

<details id="isA_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>isA</summary>
Returns true if <code>this</code> is the same as or is
an ancestor of the argument.<br/>
Examples:<br/><code>
newObject({name: "junk"}).isA(Root) => true<br/>

</code>
</details>

<details id="siblings_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>siblings</summary>
Returns an array of the siblings of <code>this</code>.
These will be the named objects that have the same prototype as <code>this</code>.<br/>
<i>Parameter</i><br/>
<b>include_this</b> Default: false. If true, returns an array of <i>all</i> the
   named objects that have the same prototype as <code>this</code>.
   If false, excludes <code>this</code> from the returned array.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/><code>
Root.siblings() => [] //the root never has siblings.
</code>
</details>

<details id="Object.areSiblings_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>areSiblings</summary>
Returns true if all arguments have the same prototype,
Otherwise returns false.
<i>Examples:</i><code>
Object.areSiblings(newObject({}), newObject({})) => true<br/>
Object.areSiblings(newObject({}), "hey") => false</br/>
</code>
</details>

<details id="inheritsPropertyFrom_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>inheritsPropertyFrom</summary>
Returns the closest ancestor to <code>this</code> that contains the
property named by the string in the argument. If <code>this</code>
happens to have that name as a property, <code>this</code> will be returned.<br/>
Returns <code>null</code> if no such prop name.
<i>Examples:</i><code>
newObject({}).inheritsPropertyFrom("isA") => Root<br/>
newObject({}).inheritsPropertyFrom("isn't a prop name") => null
</code>
</details>

<details id="ancestors_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>ancestors</summary>

Does not include <code>this</code> in the returned array.<br/>
<i>Examples:</i><br/><code>

</code>
</details>

<details id="Object.allCommonAncestors_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>allCommonAncestors</summary>
Returns an array of all the ancestors that the arguments have in common.<br/>
<i>Examples:</i><br/><code>

</code>
</details>

<details id="Object.lowestCommonAncestor_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>lowestCommonAncestor</summary>
Returns the lowest common ancestor of the arguments. If none, return null.
<i>Examples:</i><br/><code>
Object.lowestCommonAncestor(newObject(), newObject()) => Root
</code>
</details>

<details id="normal_keys_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>normal_keys</summary>
Returns an array of property names in, or inherited by, <code>this</code>.<br/>
<i>Parameters</i><br/>
<b>passing no args</b> Allowing all 4 args to default to false.<br/>
Example: <code>vehicle.normal_keys() => ["color", "weight"] </code><br/>
<b>include_inherited</b> Property names of all ancestors excluding Root are in the resulting array.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>vehicle.normal_keys(true) => ["color", "weight", "size"]  </code><br/>
<b>include_functions</b> Those properties whose values are functions are included.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>vehicle.normal_keys(true, true) => ["color", "weight", "size", "constructor"]</code><br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
<b>include_subobject_names</b> The names of the subObjects will be included.
These will be siblings, uncles, great uncles, etc. but not cousins.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true, true) => ["color", "weight", "size", "constructor", "house"] </code><br/>
<b>include_name_and_prototype</b> The keys "'name" and "prototype" will be included.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code> Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true, true, true) => ["color", "weight", "size", "constructor", "house", "name", "prototype"]</code>
<p/>
Note that you shouldn't depend on the order of the elements in the result array.
If you want to force them into a consistent order, you can sort them alphabetically.
<p/>
The use of "normal" in this method's name indicates that by passing no args,
it gets you what you'll most likely want, and passing in more and more <code>true</code> arguments
gets you more of the less-frequently used properties. (Your milage may vary,
but thats the general idea behind the name.)

</code>
</details>

<details id="sourceCode_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>sourceCode</summary>
