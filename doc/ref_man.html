    <details class="doc_details"><summary>File Access</summary>
        Web clients reading an writing files to their local file system has been impossible in the past.
        DDE gives you programmatic read/write access to all files under the dde_apps folder
        under your Documents folder, typically under the user's home folder.
        <p/>
        The code for your Job definitions should live under that folder (at any depth beneath
        that folder).
        If you do not have a dde_apps folder under your Documents folder, please create one.

        <details id="choose_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>choose_file</summary>
            Pops up a dialog box allowing you to navigate the file system to choose a file.
            Returns a string of the full path of the file.<br/>
            <i>Parameter:</i><br/>
            <b>show_dialog_options</b> A JS literal object of name-value pairs, all of which
            are optional. See the options under "showOpenDialog" in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/dialog.md">showOpenDialog</a>
            for details.<br/>
            <i>Example:</i><br/>
            <code title="not in TestSuite"> choose_file({buttonLabel: "pick the best"})</code>
        </details>

        <details id="choose_save_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>choose_save_file</summary>
            Pops up a dialog box allowing you to enter a name to save a file as,
            and navigate the file system &amp; choose a directory to save it in.
            Returns a string of the full path of the file.<br/>
            <i>Parameter:</i><br/>
            <b>show_dialog_options</b> A JS literal object of name-value pairs, all of which

        <details id="dde_apps_dir_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>dde_apps_dir</summary>
            <code>dde_apps_dir</code> is a global constant whose value is a string
            of the name of the folder beneath which DDE has programmatic access.
            You cannot set this constant. It will have a value something like:
            <code>"/Users/Fry/Documents/dde_apps"</code> on the Mac.
        </details>

        <details id="file_content_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>file_content</summary>
            <code>file_content</code> takes an argument of a file path,
            and returns a string of the content of the file.<br/>
            <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
            <b>path</b> A string of a path to the file. Usually this will not start with a slash,
            but rather tha first character of a file name inside of your dde_apps folder.
            if the path starts with a slash, it should be a complete path from the root
            of your file system, on through to dde_apps and the file below it.
            <br/>
            <b>encoding</b> A string indicating the encoding of the file. Default: "utf8".
            The default works fine for most plain text files, including .js files.
            <p/>
            <b>Example:</b> <code>file_content("dde_init.js")</code>
        </details> <!-- end file_content -->

        <details id="Editor.edit_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>Editor.edit_file</summary>
            <code>Editor.edit_file</code> takes an argument of a filepath, similar to <code>load_files</code>,
            and puts that file in DDE's editor.
            <p/>
            Its 2nd argument is a callback that takes no arguments. It is called when the file's content
            is in DDE's editor.<br/>
            <b>Example:</b> <code>Editor.edit_file("dde_init.js")</code> edits the
            file Documents/dde_apps/dde_init.js<br/>
            You can also edit docs in subfolders, ie <code>"my_fold/junk.js"</code>
        </details> <!-- end file_content -->

        <details id="file_exists_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>file_exists</summary>
            Returns true if the file path in the first argument exists.<br/>
            <I>Example</i>:<br/>
            <code>file_exists("dde_init.js")</code> => true
        </details>

        <details id="folder_separator_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>folder_separator</summary>
            A function of no arguments that returns the character used to separate folders in a filepath.
            For Windows OS's this is "\\" (backslash).
            For others its "/" (forward slash).
        </details>

        <details id="load_files_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>load_files</summary>
            <code>load_files</code> gets the content of files from disk
            (expected to be JavaScript) and evaluates
            it in the DDE environment programmatically. You can pass any number of file paths to
            load files. It will load the files sequentially, such that later files
            can depend on the contents of earlier files loaded.
            <p/>
            File paths that start with slash are absolute and have no prefix prepended to them.
            File paths that don't start with slash have a prefix appended to them.
            The default prefix is the value of <code>dde_apps_dir + "/"</code>
            A file path that is exactly <code>"/"</code> sets the prefix
            to the default.
            <p/>
            File paths that end in slash don't load files but do set the prefix to be
            prepended for files in later args.
            If such a file path starts with slash, it becomes the prefix
            (other than <code>"/"</code> , see above).
            If not, the new prefix is <code title="unEVALABLE">dde_apps_dir + "/" + path</code>
            This saves repetition of long folder names.
            <p/>
            <i>Examples</i>:<br/>
            <code title="not in TestSuite"> load_files("foo.js")</code> Loads the file in your dde_apps folder named foo.js<br/>
            <pre style="background-color:white;"><code title="not in TestSuite"> load_files(
 "c.js",   //loads .../dde_apps/c.js
 "a/b.js", //loads .../dde_apps/a/b.js
 "d/e/",   //no load but sets prefix to ".../dde_apps/d/e/"
 "f.js,    //loads .../dde_apps/d/e/f.js
 "g.js",   //loads .../dde_apps/d/e/g.js
 "/",      //no load but sets prefix to .../dde_apps/
 "h.js"    //loads .../dde_apps/h.js
)
</code></pre>
            <p/>
            load_files returns the result of evaluating the last expression in the last file loaded.
            <p/>
            It is conventional to use a file extension of ".js" for files containing JavaScript,
            but not strictly necessary.
        </details> <!-- end load_files  -->

        <details id="write_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>write_file</summary>
            Arguments:<br/>
            <b>filepath</b> The location to save to. It will overwrite the current content.
            Defaults to the file currently in the
            editor.<br/>
            <b>content</b> A string of the content you wish to be in the written file.
            Defaults to the text currently in the editor.<br/>
            Examples: <br/>
            <code>write_file("no_exist.js", "stuff")</code> Creates the named file and gives it a content of "stuff".<br/>
            <code>write_file("junk.js")</code> Gives foo.js the content now in the editor.
            This is the <i>save_as</i> functionality.<br/>
            <code>write_file("junk.js", "new content")</code> Replaces the existing content
            of the given file with "new content".<br/>
        </details>

        <!-- removed for security reasons
        <details id="folder_listing_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>folder_listing</summary>
          <code>folder_listing</code> retrieves an array of filenames and/or folder names that are somewhere
              beneath the <b>dde_apps</b> folder. This function only works if you have
              <i>Web Server for Chrome</i> installed. (See the doc for <b>load_files</b>.)<br/>
          Arguments:<br/>
          <b>folder</b> Default: <code>"/"</code>. The name of the folder to retreive the listing of.
                    A folder of "/" finds the files and/or folders immediately below the <b>dde_apps</b> folder.
                    Folder should begin and end with a slash, but if it doesn't, it will be added.<br/>
          <b>include_folders</b> Default: <code>true</code>. Retrieved folder names end in slash.<br/>
          <b>include_files</b> Default: <code>true</code>.<br/>
          <b>callback</b> Default: <code>out</code> A function of one argument. It is passed the
              array of file and/or folder names determined by the other arguments.<br/>
          Examples:<br/>
          <code>folder_listing()</code> Retrieves the files and folders immediately under <code>dde_apps</code>.<br/>
          <code>folder_listing("/test_folder/", true, false)</code> Retrieves only the folder names immediately under <code>test_folder</code>.<br/>
          <code>folder_listing("/whatever/", false, false)</code> Retrieves nothing. An empty array will be passed to the callback.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Gamepad & Keyboard</summary>
The handheld gamepad, popular in video games, are surprisingly
sophisticated input devices. They differ from keyboards in that
they have fewer keys, have some "analog" joysticks, and are usually
not "event" based like a keyboard, but rather "polled" to see
what buttons are currently pressed.
<p/>
DDE supports gamepads in this "currently pressed" mode.
DDE also can use the computer keyboard for similar "real time" input.
It is even easy to write one program that can use either
a gamepad, your computer keyboard, or both.
Because connectivity between a computer and a gamepad can
be problematic, having the option of "both" aids testing
and reliability.
    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Gamepad Setup</summary>
        Gamepads differ in number and names of keys. DDE assumes
        an XBOX One or XBOX 360 gamepad. Though we have not done
        extensive testing, probably many other gamepads will work.
        These plug into a computer via their USB connector.
        <p/>
        Windows OS supports gamepads natively. MacOS requires
        that you install driver software.
        For XBOX One & 360 gamepads, you can get a free driver
        <a href="https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <p/>
        To "initialize" the gamepad, you must press a key on it before
        you start using it. It doesn't matter which key you press.
        If DDE is not detecting key presses, try unplugging and replugging
        the gamepad USB connector and pressing a key again.
    </details>
    <details class="doc_details"><summary>down_keys</summary>
        <code>Gamepad.down_keys</code> is the primary interface
        to both gamepads and keyboards. It returns an array of literal objects
        that represent the keys on the keyboard and/or gamepad that
        are pressed when this method is called.
        <p/>
        <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
        <b>device</b> A string that determines which
        devices have their keys monitored. Valid values are <code>"keyboard"</code>,
        <code>"gamepad"</code> and <code>"keyboard_gamepad"</code>, the default.
        The default allows you to use both gamepad and keyboard simultaneously.<br/>
        <b>which_gamepad</b> You can have up to 4 gamepads plugged in to your computer,
        named 0, 1, 2, and 3. <code>0</code> is the default.
        <p/>
        <i>Returned value:</i><br/>
         <code>Gamepad.down_keys</code> returns an array
        of 0 or more literal objects, each representing a key that is down.
        The properties of these objects are:<br/>
        <b>device</b> <code>"keyboard"</code> or <code>"gamepad"</code> of the down key.<br/>
        <b>gamecode</b> An integer, usually between 0 and 16 inclusive, indicating
          the button on the gamepad that is pressed, or its equivalent from
          a keyboard key pressed. Not all keyboard keys have an equivalent gamepad button.<br/>
        <b>gamename</b> A string corresponding to the gamepad button pressed
                        or its equivalent from a keyboard key pressed.<br/>
        <b>keycode</b> An integer indicating a key on the keyboard that is pressed,
                        or its equivalent on a gamepad.
                       Note this is <i>not</i> an ascii number though keycodes are similar.
                       There are 256 possible keycodes, ranging from 0 to 255.
                       More than half (especially the upper half) are rarely used. <br/>
        <b>keyname</b> A string indicating the key on the keyboard that is pressed,
                      or its equivalent on a gamepad. For keys that have a name printed
                      on them, this is that name.
                      <p/>
                      Note that the standard QWERTY keyboards
                      have many design deficiencies. Relevant here is the fact that
                      keys indicating letters are generally labeled with their
                      upper case equivalent, even though just pressing the key gives
                      you a lower case letter. None-the-less, the keyname for lettered
                      keys is the upper case letter. For keys with two names, (i.e. 2 and @)
                      the keyname is the unshifted (lower) name (i.e. 2).
                      <p/> The space bar is named <code>" "</code>. Other names are multi-lettered,
                      upper case with underscores separating words (i.e. <code>"BACK_SPACE"</code>).
                      <br/>
        <b>value</b> A number. For most keys this is <code>1</code> indicating that
                 its down. It would be <code>0</code> when its up, but
                 down_keys only tells you about down keys.<br/>
                 Gamepad "LEFT_TRIGGER" and "RIGHT_TRIGGER" are a float varying between 0 and 1.
                 If the "LEFT_TRIGGER" was indicated using the keyboard equialent of
                 the digit keys 1, 2, 3, or 4, the values will be, correspondingly:
                 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.<br/>
                 If the "RIGHT_TRIGGER" was indicated using the keyboard equialent of
                 the digit keys 5, 6, 7, or 8, the values will be, correspondingly:
                 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.

        <details class="doc_details"><summary>stop_remembering_keydown</summary>
        <code>Gamepad.stop_remembering_keydown</code> is used to
        end the handling of keyboard down keys. Call this when
        the part of your program that uses keyboard keys for
        real-time apps is done. It takes no arguments.
    </details>
    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Job with wait_until</summary>
     This simple example of wrapping <code>Gamepad.down_keys</code>
     in a Job is not good for constructing instructions, but
     is useful for learning and when you don't need to
     extend a Job's do_list.
     <p/>
     If the function arg to <code>Robot.wait_until</code> returns false when it is called
     by the job running process, the Job continues
     waiting. Hit the ESC key on the keyboard to end the wait_until.
     Because <code title="not in TestSuite">Gamepad.down_keys()</code>
     has its first arg default to <code>"gamepad_keyboard"</code>,
     you can use either a gamepad or the keyboard, though
     as written, you must use the keyboard to end the wait_until.

    <pre><code>new Job({
  name: "gamepad_job1",
  do_list: [Robot.out("Press RIGHT arrow or ESC to exit."),
            Robot.wait_until(function(){
              let dks = Gamepad.down_keys() //returns array of down key objects
              if (dks.length == 0){ return false }  //keep waiting
              else if (dks[0].keyname == "ESCAPE"){ //end the "wait_until"
                Gamepad.stop_remembering_keydown()
                return true
              }
              else if (dks[0].keyname == "RIGHT"){
                out(dks, "green")  //your action here when RIGHT arrow key is pressed down.
                return false  //keep waiting
              }
              else {
                out(dks, "black", true)
                return false //keep waiting
              }
            }),
            Robot.out("done")
           ]})</code></pre>

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Job with generator</summary>
    Using a generator makes it relatively easy to add instructions
    to the Job based on keystrokes. The <code>Dexter.move_all_joints_relative</code>
    calls create instructions which are "yielded" i.e. returned from the generator
    and added to the Job's do_list each time an appropriate key or gamepad button
    is pressed.
    <p/>
    These calls just rotate a Dexter join by 1 degree so it moves slowly.
    You can increase that 1 degree to move faster.
    The Job's argument of <code title="unEVALable JS fragment">inter_do_item_dur: 0.05</code>
    also affects speed.
    <p/>Operation: When you start this job, press the 4 arrow keys and/or a and b keys
    on either the keyboard or a gamepad to move Dexter's joints.

     <pre><code>function* gamepad_moves(){

    <b>temp</b> Default: <code>false</code>. With the default, printed output stays in the
       Output pane until DDE is relaunched.
       <p/>
       If temp is <code>true</code>,
       then <b>val</b> is still printed in the Output pane, but is over-ridden
       by subsequence calls to out with temp == true. Calls to out with temp == false
       will erase any "temp" output.
       <p/>
       If temp is a string, then out prints <b>val</b> similarly to temp == true in that
       the previous call to out with that temp string will be over-ridden in place.
       However, when another call to out with a different value for temp occurs,
       the output of out with a temp string will <i>not</i> be erased.
       Thus the last call to out with a given temp string remains in the Output pane,
       in its place, regardless of other out calls.
    <p/>
    <i>Example:</i><code>out("hi", "blue")</code><p/>
    If you have a lot of out calls, it can be helpful to give them
    different colors so you can easily find a particular one.

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Persistent Database</summary>
        DDE has a very simple database, whose values remain in tact accross DDE sessions.
        The DB stores a JSON object. The top level is a literal object
        with string keys and values that can be any JSON objects, including null, booleans,
        numbers, strings, arrays and other literal objects nested as deep as you like.
        It is not meant to store a large amount of data, mostly preferences and
        small objects.
        <p/>
        The DB is stored in the file <code>"dde_apps/persistent.json"</code> as plain text.
        You can view the entire by opening it in DDE's editor if you like.
        However, we do not recommend editing it from DDE. That's because
        any changes will be overwritten the next time something is written
        to the DB by DDE. If you'd like to edit it as a file,
        close DDE and edit it with another editor. Be careful to
        get the JSON syntax correct.

            Retreives a literal that was set with <code>persistent_set</code>
            The argument is the key to retreive. Its default value is <code>"get_all"</code>
            which gets a JavaScript literal object that has key-value pairs for all the
            calls to <code>persistent_set</code>. If a key is not in the database,
            <code>undefined</code> will be retreived.
            <p/>
            persistent_get returns the value of the variable in the argument.<br/>
            <b>Example:</b> <br/>
            <code>persistent_set("test4", 44)</code><br/>
            <code>persistent_get("test4")</code> => <samp>44</samp><br/>

            If the argument is true, (the default), it will
            ensure that specific required properties exist, and if not,
            set them to their default value.<br/>
            If the argument is false, it will remove all the existing persistent properties
            and set the required properties to their default values.
            <p/>
            <b>Warning:</b> DDE uses the persistent db to store the keys of edited files amongst
            other things, so an argument of false will get rid of your editing history.

            <b>Example:</b> <code>persistent_remove("test4")</code><br/>
            After such a call, attempting to retreive the value of that key will get <code>undefined</code>.

            Saves all persistent values to the file dde_apps/persistent.json.
            This function is called automatically when you call <code>persistent_set</code>.
            If you modify (not set) a persistent value that is an array or a literal object,
            call this function to save it. If you have a bunch of such modifications,

<details id="recognize_speech_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>recognize_speech</summary>
    Speech recognition has a long history in AI. After many decades of research, it <i>can</i>
    be useful, but don't expect it to be as reliable as a human. DDE uses Google's speech
    recognition, which sends audio over the web to be recognized on Google's servers.
    If you don't have: 
    <ul><li>a good microphone in your computer,</li>
        <li>a quiet room,</li>
        <li>a reliable net connection or</li>
        <li>a fast net connection</li>
    </ul>
        don't attempt to use recognize_speech.
    <b><i>Be sure to crank up the volume of your mic.</i></b>
    <p/>
    The recognized text is quite good compared to recognizers of the past but, like people,
    it still makes mistakes. Recognized text comes with a <b>confidence</b> number indicating
    how good the recognizer <i>thinks</i> the text is at matching what you've said.
    In theory its nice to have this confidence number but in practice, it might
    not matter much. The number varies from 1 (very confident) to 0 (very unconfident)
    though we've seen a bunch of 0 confidence numbers for perfectly fine text.
    Also in the middle of a session, you may well see network bugs even though
    it seems like your network is fine to you. 
    <p/>
    If you are using speech to dictate
    a critical process, we recommend displaying or saying (via the <code>speak</code> function)
    the recognized text and asking the user for a simple <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> confirmation.
    <p/>
    When <b>recognize_speech</b> is called, it pops up a dialog telling you to speak. 
    The arguments to recognize_speech configure this dialog and the callbacks that receive the
    recognized text and confidence numbers. All of these are keyword arguments with defaults. See
    <button>Insert&#9660;</button> menu, <b>sound/recognize_speech</b> for an example call.
    <ul><li><b>title</b> Default: "Recognize Speech". Shows in the title bar of the dialog.
        </li>
        <li><b>prompt</b> Default: "". Displays instructions for the user at the top of the dialog.
            Can be any HTML.
        </li>
        <li><b>only_once</b> Default <code>true</code>. When <code>true</code>, the dialog is automatically closed at the end of the first phrase.
                                  When <code>false</code>, the dialog re-initializes after you pause and permits another phrase to be recognized.
                                  Say <i>finish</i> to close the dialog. 
        </li>
        <li><b>click_to_talk</b> Default <code>true</code>. When <code>true</code>, the user
             must click <button>click to talk</button> to start the recognition. 
             When <code>false</code>, recognition starts as soon as the dialog is shown,
             or as soon as it has recognized the previous phrase (when <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> only_once=false</code>).
             </li>
        <li><b>width</b> Default: <code>400</code>. The distance from the left edge of the dialog to the right edge in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>height</b> Default: <code>180</code>. The distance from the top edge of the dialog to the bottom in pixels.
             If you have multiple lines for the prompt, this should be increased. 
        </li>
        <li><b>x</b> Default: <code>400</code>. The distance from the left edge of the DDE window to the left edge of the dialog in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>y</b> Default: <code>200</code>. The distance from the top edge of the DDE window to the top of the dialog in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>background_color</b> Default: <code>"rgb(238, 238, 238)"</code> i.e. light gray. Can be one of the names (strings) in the color series.
        </li>
        <li><b>phrase_callback</b> Default <code>recognize_speech_default_phrase_callback</code>.
             This function is called when the user pauses after speaking. 
             It is passed the recognized text, and the confidence number (0 to 1).
             If only_once=true, only this callback is called.
             The default prints these two arguments into the Output pane.
         </li>
        <li><b>finish_callback</b> Default <code>null</code> meaning no action.
             This function is called when the user says the finish_phrase.
             It is passed an array of arrays. Each inner array has elements of the text
             and the confidence number of each phrase spoken in this use of recognize_speech.
             This argument is moot if <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> only_once=true</code>.
         </li>
         <li><b>finish_phrase</b> Default: <code>"finish"</code>. The phrase that the user should speak to

<details id="speak_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>speak</summary>
<code>speak</code> uses text to speech technology.<br/>
<i>Parameter:</i><br/>
<b>speak_data</b> Default: "hello". If the argument is a literal object
with a field of "speak_data", then the value of "speak_data" is spoken
with vocal characteristics indiated by the other properties of
the literal object. Otherwise, the argument is the data to be spoken

By passing a literal object, you can control many aspects of <code>speak</code>.
The <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> speak_data</code> input can be any JavaScript data
(such as a boolean, a number, a date, an array, etc.) and it will do its best to say it out loud.<br/>

        <code>get_page</code> retrieves the contents of a web page.
        You pass in a url and get_page returns the contents as a string.
        The argument can either be a string of a url, or a literal JS object.<br/>
        Example: <code title="not in TestSuite"> get_page("http://ibm.com")</code><br/>
        If there is an error, the returned string will start with "Error:"

    <details id="make_url_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>make_url</summary>
        <i>url</i> is a poorly designed language for transfering data on the web.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">Documentation.</a>
        It's normal behavior is as an asyncrhonous function call, where the
        call is typically on a web device known as a 'client', and it is sent to
        a different device on the web known as a 'server'.
        <p/>
        Usually its used to
        get the content of a web page into a browser. Usually the content of a web page
        is written in a polyglot of languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) but
        we can use urls to retrieve data in other syntaxes such as JSON or just plain strings.
        <p/>
        <i>make_url</i> does two things:
        <ol><li>Prepends "http://" to the url being constructed, if it looks like
            there is no protocol in the url already. If there is no "://" in the
            first 16 chars of the url, it prepends "http://". If you want a
            different protocol, such as https, or you are using "://" in the value
            of an argument, you should include the protocol in the passed in url.</li>
            <li>Makes creating arguments easier and appends them to the end of the url.</li>
        </ol>
        <i>Parameters</i>:<br/>
        <b>url</b>: A string containing the base url. If the protocol is to be "http",
        you can omit it in most cases.<br/>
        Example: <code>"www.ibm.com"</code><br/>means the same thing as<br/>
        <code>"http://www.ibm.com"</code><br/>
        <b>arguments</b>: A string of arguments, formally called a <i>query string</i>.<br/>
        Example: <code>"x=123&y=45&color=blue"</code> <i>OR</i>
        A literal object with name-value pairs representing the arguments.<br/>
        Example:<br/><code>{x: 123, y: 45, color: "blue"}</code><br/>
        This later form makes it easy to compute and set indivudal args.<br/>
        Example:<pre><code>
      var args = {x: 12.3 * 10}
      args.y = 40 + 5

<details id='Job_doc_id' class="doc_details"><summary>Job</summary>
A job contains a do_list of instructions that it feeds to a robot to make things.
The syntax of defining a job is:
<pre><code>new Job({name: "j1", 
         robot: Robot.dexter0,
         do_list: [ Dexter.move_to([0, 0.5, 0.075]),

                    //...
                   ]
        })</code></pre>
Defined jobs remain inert until they are started like so:<br/>
<code title="not in TestSuite"> Job.j1.start()</code><br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code> initializes the job and feeds the instructions in its do_list to
the job's robot, which executes the instructions. Jobs either run to completion,
error, or are stopped by the user via <button>Jobs&#9660;</button> menu <b>Stop all jobs</b>.
Stopped jobs may be restarted by calling <code title="not in TestSuite"> Job.j1.start()</code> again.
This reinitializes the job with the original arguments passed to <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new Job</code>
and runs the do_list instructions again. 

<details id="new_job_parameters_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>new Job parameters</summary>
The parameters used to define a new Job are:
    <ol><li><b>name</b> You can use <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.a_job_name</code> to get the instance programmatically.</li>
        <li><b>robot</b> An instance of one of the subclasses of <code>Robot</code>, such as
            <code>Dexter</code>, designating where
            this Job's instructions are sent.</li>
        <li><b>do_list</b> An array of instructions to be sent to the job's robot when the
             Job is run. There are a number of different kinds of instructions, including
             user-defined JavaScript functions that can call arbitrary JS code.
             Instructions may add additional instructions to the do_list by returning
             them as a single instruction or an array of instructions.
             Such instructions are inserted into the do_list just below the instruction that 
             made them.
             <p/>Instructions are documented with the kind of robot that they run on.
        </li>
        <li><b>keep_history</b> true or false, default true. If true, the robot_status arrays
            returned from running instructions on the robot
            are stored in <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.the_job_name.rs_history</code>.
            This is useful for debugging, but uses memory, which can be
            saved by setting keep_history to <code>false</code>.</li>
        <li><b>show_instructions</b> Possible values:
           <ul><code>true</code> The default. Each time Dexter begins the execution of an instruction, it
               is printed in the Output pane, refreshing that section of the output pane as
               each new instruction is run. The method used is <code>Job.prototype.show_instruction</code>.
               Eval that to see its source code.</li>
               <li><code>false</code> Do nothing. Use this for time-sensitive jobs.</li>
               <li>A method</li> The method will be called (with the job as <code title="unEVALable">this</code>)
                   as each instruction is run, so you can do whatever you like.
                   A function written for this purpose is
                   <code>Job.prototype.show_instruction_and_user_data</code>.
                   This allows you to see user data as it is updated by the job.

        <li><b>inter_do_item_dur</b> A number indicating the number of milliseconds between
           when an instruction is completed by its robot, and when the next instruction is
           computed and sent to the robot of the job. This "taking a breath" gives other
           jobs a chance to run. Default 100.</li>
        <li><b>user_data</b> A literal object of name-value pairs where arbitrary data created
           at the beginning of a job or during the execution of an instruction can be stored
           and retrieved. Default <code>{}</code> (an empty object).
           It can be initialized in the call to new job like so:<br/>
           <code>new Job ({name:"j22", user_data:{color: "blue", weight: 123} })</code><br/>
           Within an instruction, you can get a user_data value via 
           <br/><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.user_data.color</code></br>
           or set it via<br/>
           <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.user_data.color = "green"</code></br>
           You can set existing user_data names or create new ones by setting them.
           <p/>
           user_data is persistent only while a job is executing. If you restart the
           job, its user_data is lost. For data that you want to persist across restarts,
           or for user_data that doesn't really belong with any one job but is used
           by mulitple ones, use the <i>class</i> property <code>Job.global_user_data</code>.
           This can be written to like so: <code>Job.global_user_data.my_count = 123</code>.
           <p/>
           The value for user_data is passed in when creating a job is shallow_copied when
           the job starts. So if this value was stored in some external-to-the-job way
           and a job is run twice with that very same user_data, the 2nd time the job
           is started, it will see <i>the same</i> top level keys as the first time,
           and all the top level values that are immutable (booleans, strings, numbers).
           However, if there is a mutable value (say an element of an array or a literal object,
           the first job might have modified that and that modification will be see
           when the job is run a 2nd time. Mostly all this doesn't matter because
           most jobs don't use user_data at all. Others look at it but don't
           write to it, and most of the others would only write top level, immutable
           values to it. But nested mutable data in user_data can "leak" over to
           another running of a job, or even other jobs. This might or might not
           be what you want.
           <p/>
           <code>Job.global_user_data</code> is initialized to <code>{}</code> when DDE launches.
           You can store data here that you wish to persist across running jobs, but realize
           that if a job modifies <code>Job.global_user_data</code>, the 2nd time that
           job is run, it will see a different <code>Job.global_user_data</code> than the first.        
           If you want data to persist across launches, see 
           <b>Reference Manual/IO/Persistent Database</b>.         
           </li>
        <li><b>program_counter</b> Initialize the program_counter to an instruction id.
        The default is 0. You can use any instruction_location here. See Robot.go_to
        for documentation on all the different kinds of instruction_locations.
        </li>
        <li><b>ending_program_counter</b> Declare at the outset of a job that it
            will not execute the indicated instruction or beyond. This can be any
            valid instruction_location that does not include a job. It is evaluated
            at the start of each instruction, so if labels move as a result of
            dynamically added instructions, that's OK.
            The default is "end". See <code>Robot.go_to</code>
            for documentation on all the different kinds of instruction_locations.
        </li>
        <li><b>initial_instruction</b> Add an initial instruction to the do_list at
        the location of program_counter. Thus this instruction will be executed
        first when the job is run. Default null (no instruction added).
        </li>
        <li><b>when_stopped</b> controls what happens when a job stops normally.<br/>
             <code>"stop"</code> The default. The job stops.<br/>
             <code>"wait"</code> The job waits for another instruction to be added
               at the end of the do_list. Call <code>Job.insert_instruction</code>
               from any JavaScript code to do this.<br/>
             <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> A function</code> When the job reaches its normal stopping point,
             the function is called with a 'this' of the job instance and no arguments.
             This is effectively a callback when the job is done.<br/>
             <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> An instruction location</code> This is similar to Robot.go_to
             except that the job is re-iniitlizated with its original (as defined) do_list.
             Any valid instruction location can be used (see doc in Robot.go_to) except
             that it must have no job or indicate the current job. Using <code>0</code>
             set's the job's program counte to instruction 0, causing the job to loop.
             Using an instruction location 'offset' of greater than 0, such as a label,
             will cause the initial running of the job to execute its top instructions,
             but then subsequent iterations will start somewhere in the middle.<br/>
             A Robot.stop_job instruction can be used to end a loop.

<details id="start_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>start</summary>
   <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code> is an instance method on <code>Job</code> that
   causes the job instance to feed its do_list to the Job's robot instance.
   After a job instance is done running, you can call <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code>
   again to run it again.<p/>
   <i>Example</i> <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.start()</code><p/>
   <i>Parameters</i><br/>
   <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code> takes an object literal as its argument with the
   same names and values as <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new Job</code> except that it can't
   take "name" as a property (i.e. you can't rename the job when you start it).
   Below are two of the most useful properties you can use:<br/>
    <li><b>program_counter</b> Initialize the program_counter to an instruction id.
        The default is 0. You can use any instruction_location here. See Robot.go_to
        for documentation on all the different kinds of instruction_locations.
    </li>
    <li><b>initial_instruction</b> Add an initial instruction to the do_list at
        the location of program_counter. Thus this instruction will be executed
        first when the job is run. Default null (no instruction added).
    </li>
    Note that these parameters override the same-named properties used in making
    a new job, but they are only used for this call to start. They
    do not perminently affect the job definition.<br/>
    <i>Example</i>:<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.start({program_counter: "highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"})</code><br/>
    If a job errored the last time it ran, you can use this to restart the job
    with the errored instruction being the first one run.

<details id="Job.insert_instruction_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>insert_instruction</summary>
Insert an instruction into a Job's do_list at a particular location.<br/>
<i>Parameters</i>:<br/>
<b>instruction</b> The instruction to insert. This can be an array of instructions
if you effectively want to insert more than one.<br/>
<b>location</b> Any instruction_location documented under <code>Robot.go_to</code> can be used
including integers, names of labels, etc. <br/>
<i>Example</i>: <pre><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.insert_instruction(Robot.out("the end"),
                       {job: "my_job",
                        offset: "end"})</code></pre><br/>
Adds an instruction that prints "the end" at the end of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.do_list</code>.<br/>
The instruction <code>Robot.send_to_job</code> performs the core of this functionality
in an instruction format.<br/>
See <code>Robot.wait_until</code> documentation for its "new_instruction" argument
on how to continually add and execute a new instruction in a running job.
</details>


</details> <!-- end job -->


<details class="doc_details"><summary>Robots</summary>
  A robot is a machine that can execute the instructions in its instruction set. In general,
  each kind of robot will have its own instruction set. The primary
  difference between robots is the difference in their instruction sets.
  
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Robot Instructions</summary>
These instructions can be used for any robot, as can the instructions for
the Human robot.
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Any JS Function Def</summary>
Any function definition can be put on the do_list as an instruction.
When it is run, the function is called with <code>this</code>
being the instance of Job that the function def is in. Since you can put any
JavaScript inside a function definition, you can have an instruction
execute any JS whatsoever.
<p/>
Often you'll make functions that have no returned value.
If so, after the function is called, then the next instruction
on the do_list will be run. But if the function returns
another instruction, or an array of instructions, then those
will be inserted into the do_list immediately below the
function def, and they will be run next.
<p/>
<i>The below functionality is advanced use of DDE.</i><br/>
The function
body might have an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> in it. Under certain
conditions the function will return one instruction,
and it other cases, it will return another (or <code>null</code>, meaning
just do the next instruction on the do_list, or an array of
instructions to do them all).
<p/>
If a function returns the special string
<code>"dont_call_set_up_next_do"</code>,
then that will cause nothing to happen in the job. It won't advance.
This is not a good thing to do by itself, but you might
want to conditionally call
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.set_up_next_do()</code>. This tells DDE to
continue processing this job's instructions.
The argument to this function is an integer saying how much
to increment the program counter. It defaults to 1, meaning
do the next instruction. Another useful value is 0,
which will mean that after a short pause, run this instruction
again. Then in some other running of the instruction, a different
branch of an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> may be taken that will call
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.set_up_next_do(1)</code> causing the job to proceed.
<i>Example</i>:<pre><code>function pause_a_bit(){
   if (new Date().getSeconds() < 30){
      this.set_up_next_do(0)
   }
   else {
      this.set_up_next_do(1)
   }
   return "dont_call_set_up_next_do"
}
</code></pre>
The above example could better be implemented using
<code>Robot.wait_until</code>, but there are
cases where the increased flexibility of the above is convenient.
<p/>
You can put both named and anonymous functions on a do_list.
A named instruction allows you to add a bit of "documentation" to
the function. You can also use the name of a function like a
label and "go to"
that name using a <code>Robot.go_to</code> instruction,
or use the function's name in
any uses of an instruction_location.
<p/>
If you name your function definition,
you can define it <i>outside</i> of the do_list, then just
have its name in the do_list source code. This lets you put
the same function in multiple locations on the do_list and
only have to define it once.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Any JS Code</summary>
If you have some JavaScript code that you want to go between 2
other instructions on a Job's do_list, your first inclination
might be to just stick it on the do_list like so
<pre><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> do_list: [Robot.out("hi"),
          my_fn(12, 34),
          Robot.out("bye")
          ]
</code></pre>
What happens here is that when the <i>definition</i> of the job is evaled,
the function my_fn will be called with args 12 and 34.
Whatever that function returns will be put on the do list
between the other 2 instuctions.
So if my_fn  <i>returns</i> an instruction to run, and the making of that instruction
does not depend on anything that happens while running the instructions of the job,
then you're all set.
<br/>
<b>BUT</b> if what you want is for the eval of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> my_fn(12, 34)</code>
to occur after the instruction returned by <code>Robot.out("hi")</code> is run,
then you'll want to wrap your code in a function, and put the definition
of that wrapper function on the do_list like so:<br/>
<code>function(){ my_fn(12, 34) }</code><br/>
In the body of the above function, <code>this</code> will be bound
to the instance of the running job.
Note that if calling my_fn returns an instruction (or an array of instructions)
that you want to run in the job, then our code for this do_list item should
look like:
    <code>function(){ return my_fn(12, 34) }</code>
<p/>
If you are confused about what a given instruction on a Job's do_list
returns, just select it in the editor and EVAL it.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Any JS Generator</summary>
A relatively new feature of JavaScript is generators.
A generator is a function that can effectively return a value
in the middle of its definition via 'yield', then be called again
and resume after the previous 'yield'.
<a target="_blank" href="https://davidwalsh.name/es6-generators">Tutorial</a>
<p/>
A generator can be used as a do-list instruction.
Running a job automatically handles the re-calling
of a generator until it is exhausted i.e. no more
yield statements, or a return statement is executed.
<p/>
Generators are useful when you want to dynamically compute
a bunch of instructions, but are not sure how many until
after you've started generating the instructions. Real-time
control or interaction with other jobs often have these chracteristics.
<p/>
Usually a generator will have one or more yield statements
with a following value of a dynamcially computed instruction
to insert and run in the job. The software that controls
the execution of instructions in a Job will call a generator's
"next" method until the "done" flag is returned,
in which case the generator is done and on the
next iteration of the job, the following instruction will
be run.
<p/>
You may have a yield statement
with nothing following it to simply do nothing for
that iteration, but the generator will still be called
for the next job iteration until the generator is exhausted.
<p/>
<p>The body of a generator looks like a function.
Often its yield statement(s) will be wrapped in a loop,
that has an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> statement with
a clause (or more) that terminates the loop by calling <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> return</code>
and a clause (or more) that uses <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> yield</code> to produce
an instruction.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><pre><code>
function* my_gen(){
  while(true){
    if(Math.random() > 0.2) {
        yield Robot.out("my_gen still alive")
    }
    else { return Robot.out("gotta go") }
  }
}
new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [my_gen]})
</code></pre>
</p>
See DDE menu bar/Jobs/Insert Example/Generators<br/>
for code examples. Related Job facilities are:
<ul><li>
 using instruction
<code>Robot.wait_until("new_instruction")</code></li>
<li>Job parameter: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> when_stopped</code></li>
</ul>
</details>


<details id="Robot.error_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>error</summary>
  Causes the job to error, immediately stopping it.
  The one argument is a string of a reason for the error which
  will aid in debugging. Example:<pre><code>Robot.error("fubar")</code></pre>
</details>

<details id="Robot.get_page_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>get_page</summary>
  Similar to the function <code>get_page</code>, only made into an instruction.
  This instruction gets the content of a url and places it in a given user_data variable
  on the job instance before allowing the next instruction in the do_list to run.<br/>
  Example:<pre><code>new Job({name: "j1",
         do_list: [Robot.get_page("http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/acromine/dictionary.py?sf=BMI"),
                   function(){out("got response of: " + 
                                    this.user_data.http_response)}
         ]}) </code></pre>
  <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>url_or_options</b>: The url whose contents this instruction gets.<br/>
    Instead of a url as the argument, you can pass a literal JS object with lots of options, described at:
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">options</a>
    <p/>
  <b>response_variable_name</b>: Default: <code>"http_response"</code>. The name
     of the property in the job instance's user_data object to set to the
     content of the url.
  <p/>
Using <code>make_url</code> can help make constructing calls to <code>get_page</code> a bit easier.
Example:<pre><code title="not in TestSuite"> Robot.get_page(make_url("www.nactem.ac.uk/software/acromine/dictionary.py",
                         {sf: "BMI"}))</code></pre>
<code>make_url</code> is documented in the reference manual under "I/O".
</details> <!-- end get_page -->

<details id="Robot.go_to_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>go_to</summary>
In the 1960's programs were usually characterized by a list of instructions.
As more flexible control was needed, the "goto" instruction was added to
cause the program_counter that was pointing at the executing instruction to jump to
a new location, instead of just incrementing. Overuse
of this control structure gave rise to difficult-to-debug code and
goto fell out of favor, to the extent that it isn't even <i>in</i> popular modern
general purpose languages.
<p/>
The process of making things often has a long list
of instructions that are executed sequentially. DDE provides the
more conventional function calling, including return, if, and for loops.
But sometimes the most convenient thing to do is "leap over" some instructions
on a job's do_list and proceed from there.
Thus DDE provides the taboo <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> go_to</code> instruction.
Don't use it a lot. Going backwards is particularly dangerous.
But we give you enough rope to hang yourself or build a masterpiece.
<p/>
DDE's go_to is more versatile than go_to's of the past.
If this complexity is too hard, just don't use it.
<p/>
The go_to instruction takes just one argument: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code>.
It has a number of different kinds of arguments.<br/>
<b>a positive integer</b> Moves the program counter to the indicated instruction id.
The instruction at that id will be the one executed after the go_to instruction.<br/>
<b>a negative integer</b> Sets the program counter to the length of the
do_list, plus this negative integer. Thus an integer of -1 sets the program counter
to the last instruction, so that it will be executed next. -2 goes to the second to last
instruction, etc.<br/>
<b>the name of a label instruction</b> The program counter is set to that label's id.<br/>
<b>the name of a sync_point instruction</b> The program counter is set to that instruction's id.<br/>
<b>the name of a function def instruction</b> The program counter is set to that instruction's id.<br/>
<b>the type of instruction</b> Examples:
<code>"go_to"</code> <code>"label"</code> <code>"sync_point"</code> etc.
For example, if we have "label", then we're not going to a specific label, just
the next instruction of type "label" found.<br/>
<b>Instruction oplet</b> Low level instructions to Dexter have a letter that
designates their type. For example <code>"a"</code> would refer to
the <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code> instruction. You can see the oplet for
an instruction by evaling the call to make it, i.e. <code>Dexter.move_all_joints([45])</code><br/>
<b>"program_counter"</b> Set's the program_counter to the program_counter. Only useful
when the instruction_location is an array. <br/>
<b>"before_program_counter"</b> Set's the program_counter to the instruction just
before the program_counter.<br/>
<b>"after_program_counter"</b> Set's the program_counter to the instruction just
    after the program_counter.<br/>
<b>"end"</b> Sents the program counter to one greater than the last instruction id,
effectively ending the job.<br/>
<b>"next_top_level"</b> A top level instruction can cause multiple instructions to
be inserted right beneath it. This sets the program counter to the next top level
instruction, even though it may now be executing "sub" instructions. <br/>
<b>"highest_completed_instruction"</b> When you are re-starting a job, this
becomes handy to start the job at the last instruction that completed.
Perhaps the instruction completed, but it inadvertently caused an error.
You can fix the problem, then rerun that last instruction and continue on.
Take care to not execute that last instruction twice if you don't want to.
You can go one beyond it like so:<br/>
<code>["highest_completed_instruction", 1]</code><br/>
<b>"highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"</b> Like <code>"highest_completed_instruction"</code>
but if the job hasn't been started yet, or has completed successfully,
this sets the program_counter to its default, 0 so that the first
executed instruction will be the first instruction in the do_list.
Generally <code>"highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"</code> is more useful than
    <code>"highest_completed_instruction"</code>.
<br/>
<b>A literal object</b> The literal object can have up to three properites.
<ul><li><b>offset</b> Can be any one of the above instruction_locations.<br/>
    <i>Example</i>: <code>{offset: 12}</code>
    </li>
    <li><b>process</b> Describes how the offset is searched for. Note that since
      you may have more than one label with a given name, the order in which
      you traverse the do_list looking for such labels can matter. Possible values:
    <ul><li><b>forward</b> Search forward from the current location (default 0)
        for the location in the <code title="unEVALable code fragment">  offset</code>
        <i>Example</i>: <code>{offset: "label3", process: "forward"}</code>
        searches forward from the current location in the do_list to
        the first label or sync_point instruction named "label3".
        If it is not found, error.
        </li>
        <li><b>backward</b> Search backwards for the location of the offset. Error
        if not found.</li>
        <li><b>forward_then_backward</b> Search forward from the current location
        to the end of the do_list. If the offset is not found, search backwards from
        the current location. Error if not found. This is the default process.</li>
        <li><b>backward_then_forward</b> Search backward from the current location
            to the beginning of the do_list. If the offset is not found, search forwards from
            the current location. Error if not found.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>job</b> An instruction location can indicate a job of the described instruction.
    By default, that's the job that the go_to instruction is in. But you can
    tell another job to jump to a new instruction for its next instruction
    if you like. <br/>
    <i>Example</i>: <code>{job: "my_other_job", offset: "label3"}</code></li>
    <li><b>An array</b></li> There may not be a convenient "one shot" way to
    describe a location, however, by using two or more designators, you may
    better be able to describe it.<br/>
    <i>Examples</i>:<br/>
    <code>["myLabel", 1]</code> indicates the instruction immediately after "myLabel".<br/>
    <code>["myLabel", -1]</code> indicates the instruction immediately before "myLabel".<br/>
    <code>["program_counter", {offset: "sync_point", process: "backward"}]</code>
    Searches backwards from the program_counter to
    the first instruction of type "sync_point".<br/>
</ul>
Instruction_locations are also used in
initializing a Job's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> program_counter</code> in defining the job, as well as
in calling a job's start method. The <code>Robot.send_to_job</code> instruction
uses an instruction_location for identifying
where within the job to insert the given instruction as does the method
<code>Job.insert_instruction</code>.

   <b>start_index</b> A non-negative integer signifying the

                  then the value will be: For a Serial robot, the first "item"
                  returned from the serial port in response to a send.
                  For Dexter, it will be DMA_READ_DATA.
                  <p/>

In order to insure that the Dexter robot_status array is up to date,
you should place <code>Dexter.get_robot_status()</code> in your do_list before
the grab_robot_status instruction.<br/>
<i>Examples of 2 adjacent instructions on a job's do_list:</i><br/>

    <code>Dexter.get_robot_status()</code><br/>
    <code>Robot.grab_robot_status("my_zero_data", Serial.DATA0) </code><br/>
See Job Example 9 for an extended example.

<details id="Robot.if_any_errors_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>if_any_error</summary>
    <code>Robot.if_any_error</code> checks to see if any of the supplied jobs have errored.
    If so, it inserts the supplied instruction into the do_list on the job
    that this instruction is on. In either case, <code>Robot.if_any_error</code> continues
    the job that its on.
    <i>Parameters</i><br/>
    <b>job_names</b> An array of strings of job names. If a named job doesn't exist, error.<br/>
    <b>instruction_if_error</b> An instruction that will be inserted into the do_list
    immediately after this instruction IF one of the named jobs has errored.
    The default for <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_if_error</code> is a function that
    inserts an instance of Robot.error into the do_list of this job, causing it to error.
    The "reason" for that error instruction is explicit about the cause of the error.
    <p/>
    Generally a job should be stopped quickly if there is an error.
    This instruction makes it easy to stop jobs that are concurrently cooperating
    with the current job. The instruction_if_error can be a function (called with the
    current job for "this") so that some arbitrary compensation can be made for the error.
</details>

<details id="Robot.label_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>label</summary>
This instruction is a no-op. However, it provides a target location
for <code>Robot.go_to</code>, initializing the program_counter of a job, and
a location to insert an instruction using <code>Robot.send_to_job</code>.<br/>
<i>Example</i>: <code>Robot.label("lab2")</code>
</details>

<details id="Robot.out_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>out</summary>
  Very similar to the function <code>out</code> but made for use as a robot instruction.
  Prints a message to the Output pane in the color of your choice.
  This is the "print statement" as an instruction, so useful in debugging.<p/>
  <i>Example:</i><br/>
  <code>Robot.out("hey " + 345, "green")</code><p/>
  <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>val</b> Any JavaScript data. Most commonly this is a string, but
             can be a number, an array etc.<br/>
  <b>color</b> A string representing a color. Default "black". Can
             be any string in the <b>color</b> series, or have the format:<br/>
             <code>"rgb(255, 100, 0)"</code>.<br/>
  <b>temp</b> Default: <code>false</code>. With the default, printed output stays in the
    Output pane until DDE is relaunched.
    <p/>
    If temp is <code>true</code>,
    then <b>val</b> is still printed in the Output pane, but is over-ridden
    by subsequence calls to out with temp == true. Calls to out with temp == false
    will erase any "temp" output.
    <p/>
    If temp is a string, then out prints <b>val</b> similarly to temp == true in that
    the previous call to out with that temp string will be over-ridden in place.
    However, when another call to out with a different value for temp occurs,
    the output of out with a temp string will <i>not</i> be erased.
    Thus the last call to out with a given temp string remains in the Output pane,
    in its place, regardless of other out calls.
  <p/>
  This is the most basic debugging tool, often used to let you know that 
  the job its in has reached this instruction. Unlike an instruction such as:<br/>
  <code>function(){out("The status is: " + this.status_code)}</code><br/>
  Robot.out cannot access its job instance, but it does print out
  its job name and instruction ID right before printing <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> val</code>.

<details id="Robot.start_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>start_job</summary>
 <code>Robot.start_job</code> starts another job.<br/>
 <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
 <b>job_name</b> A String. The name of the job to start.<br/>
 <b>start_options</b> A literal object. Name-value pairs that can
 be passed when creating a new Job and to a job's <i>start</i> method<br/>
 <i>Example</i>: <code>{program_counter: 2}</code> <br/>
    causes the job to be started, executing its 3rd do_list item first.<br/>
 <b>if_started</b> A string. Says what to do if the job that
 is to be started has a status of <b>"running" or "waiting"</b>.
 Valid values for this argument are:
 <ul><li><code>"ignore"</code> Don't start the job. Just do nothing. This is the default.</li>
     <li><code>"error"</code> Stop the job running this instruction with an error.</li>
     <li><code>"restart"</code> Stop and restart the job named by <b>job_name</b>.</li>
</ul>

If the status of the job to be started is:<br/>
<b>starting</b>, this instruction is ignored.<br/>
<b>suspended</b> The job is unsuspended.<br/>
<b>"not_started", "completed", "errored", or "interrupted"</b>
The job is started.<br/>
<b>"running" or "waiting"</b> then what happens depends on the
value of the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if_started</code> argument.
</details>

<details id="Robot.stop_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>stop_job</summary>
  Causes the indicated job to stop just before executing a particular instruction.<br/>
  <i>Parameters</i>:<br/>
  <b>instruction_location</b> Determines the job to stop and the instruction within that
  job that it should stop before executing. If <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code> does
  not indicate a job, then the job that this instruction is in will be stopped.
  If <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code> is not given, then
  the offset will be <code>"program_counter"</code>, i.e. the job will
  stop before executing its next instruction. Thus the default is that
  the current job will be stopped immediately. See Robot.go_to for details
  on the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code> format.<br/>
  <b>reason</b> A string. The reason that the job is being told to stop.<br/>
  <b>perform_when_stopped</b> A boolean. When <code>false</code> (the default)
  the job will behave as if its 'when_stopped' parameter is <code>"stop"</code>,
  i.e. the job will end. When <code>true</code>, the job's when_stopped action will
  be performed.<br/>
  Example:<code>Robot.stop_job({job: "my_job", offset: "label1"})</code>
  <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job</code> will stop when it reaches the instruction named "label1".
</details>

<details id="Robot.suspend_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>suspend</summary>
  Causes the job to pause. It will not execute any more of its instructions 
  until it is unsuspended. It takes no arguments.
  Example:<code>Robot.suspend()</code>.
  <p/>
  <b>unsuspend</b> is a method on a job.<br/> 
  Example:<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.unsuspend()</code>.
  This causes the job to resume from a suspension. You can call it
  from any JavaScript code such as in a function that's a do_list item.
  A job cannot unsuspend itself.
</details>

<details id="Robot.sync_point_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>sync_point</summary>
  A sync_point instruction cases all running jobs with the same-named sync_point
  to pause until they all reach the sync_point. Once that happens, they
  are all allowed to proceed executing their instructions.<br/>
  <i>Parameters</i><br/>
  <b>name</b> The name of the sync point. Must be identical with other sync points
              that you expect to be in-sync. There should only be one sync_point
              with a given name in a job.<br/>
  <b>job_names</b> An array of job names containing same_named sync points that
    you want to all pause at the same place. A sync_point instruction may
    contain the name of the job its in. Effectly that doesn't matter,
    but does allow all the same-named sync points to have the same list of job_names.<br/>
    Example: <code>Robot.sync_point("midway", ["job_one", "job_two"])</code><br/>
   <p/>
   If a sync point instruction has no job names, or only its own job name,
   it will not wait but rather breeze right through its sync_point.
   <p/>
   By having different job_names, you can configure a sync_point in one job
   to wait for the other job's sync point to be reached, yet <i>not</i> have
   the other job wait for the first job. Any combination of such lop-sided
   waits can be set up amongst jobs with same-named sync_points for
   a lot of flexibility. This can increase the overall speed of a cooperating
   robot group over merely "all pause at each same-named sync_points" 
   because it allows those jobs that <i>can</i> proceed to do so.
</details>

<details id="Robot.send_to_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>send_to_job</summary>
<code>Robot.send_to_job</code> inserts instructions into another job's do_list. It can also
start, unsuspend and grab data from another job. <code>Robot.send_to_job</code> is complex, powerful,
and rarely used. Example: <pre>
Robot.send_to_job({do_list_item: Dexter.move_to([0, 0.5, 0.075]),
                   where_to_insert: "end",
                   unsuspend: true,
                   wait_until_done: true})</pre>
<i>Parameters:</i><ul>
<li><b>do_list_item</b> An instruction or array of instructions to insert into the to_job.</li>
<li><b>where_to_insert</b> The location in the do_list of the to_job to insert the do_list_item.
  The full list of instruction_locations for <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> where_to_insert</code>
  can be seen in the documentation for the <code>Robot.go_to</code> instruction.
  Particularly useful ones for send_to_job are:<br/>
  <ul><li><code>{job: "other_job", offset: "next_top_level"}</code> Inserts the do_list_item
  after the program_counter and just before the next original (top level) do_list item
  in the referenced job.
  If a function do_list item in to_job returns an array of instructions,
  this ensures that the inserted do_list_item will not go in the middle of such instructions.
  Thus if the instructions from the function must be executed as a continuous group, 
  "next_top_level" is a safe place to insert additional do_list items.</li>
    </li>
    <li><code>"after_program_counter"</code> Immediately after the destination job's program_counter.
    Not as safe as "next_top_level".</li>
    <li><code>"end"</code> At the very end of the do_list. With no job designator,
    this will extend the current job's do_list by one new instruction on the end.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
 <li><b>wait_until_done</b> (default false) If true, the from_job will wait until the to_job
    executes its newly inserted instructions.</li> 
 <li><b>start</b> (default false) If true, and the to_job has yet to be started,
    it will be started after the do_list_item is inserted into its do_list.
    <p/>
    If a job has yet to be started and you send instructions to it, those
    instructions will be stored in a special place until the job is started.
    During the start process, after the do_list is made but before the
    initial_instruction (if any) is prepended to the do_list,
    the sent instructions will be inserted into the do_list at
    the location specified in 'where_to_insert'. These instructions will
    be used for that initial running of the job only. Even if the job is running
    at the time its sent instructions, they will only run in that running of the job.
    They will not be present if you restart the job. Restarating the job uses
    the do_list defined for the job only.
 </li>
 <li><b>unsuspend</b> (default false) If true, and the to_job is suspended,
     the to_job will be unsuspended after the do_list_item is inserted into its do_list.</li> 
 <li><b>status_variable_name</b> The name of a field placed in the user_data of the from_job.
     It is initialized to <code>"sent"</code>. When the inserted do_list_item has been executed,
     this field is set to <code>"done"</code>. </li> 
  <li><b>other variable names</b> If a parameter to send_to_job is not one of the above,
    it is assumed to be the name of a field to create in the user_data of the to_job.
    "Other variable names" have a value of a function. After the do_list_item is executed,
    the function for each of the other varible names is called within the to_job and
    the returned value is set to its corresponding other variable name in the 
    user_data of the from_job. This allows the from_job to get data from the to_job
    immediately after the do_list_item is run. </li>
 </ul>
 To achieve the same effect of send_to_job, see documention on the method
    <code>Job.insert_instruction</code>.
</details> <!-- end send_to_job -->

<!-- obsoleted by initial_instruction and insert_instruction <details id="Robot.sent_from_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>sent_from_job</summary>
This instruction is typically not created by users directly. send_to_job creates
such an instruction and places it on the to_job as a container for the newly inserted
instructions. However, if you want to extend the do_list of a job when starting it,
you can pass an instance of <code>sent_from_job</code> as an option
of start. This will insert the new instruction(s) just before the job is started.
Example:<pre>Job.j8.start({sent_from_job: Robot.sent_from_job(
          {do_list_item: function(){out("special insert")},
           where_to_insert: "sp1"})})
</pre>
<b>do_list_item</b> can be a single instruction or an array of instructions.<br/>
<b>where_to_insert</b> See doc for send_to_job<br/>
The inserted instructions will not be present if, after running the job,
you call start with no argument.
</details> --> <!-- end sent_from_job -->

<details id="Robot.wait_until_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>wait_until</summary>
This instruction causes a job to pause until the supplied condition is met.<br/>
Example:<code>Robot.wait_until(2)</code><br/>
The one argument can be:
<ul><li><b>an integer</b> The number of seconds for the wait. </li>
    <li><b>an instance of Date</b> Causes a wait until the JavaScript date occurs. 
         Careful, you can easily cause a job to wait for years!</li>
    <li><b>a function</b> The function is called at each do_loop iteration.
          The function's return value is used in a JavaScript <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> statement.
          false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, or the empty string ("") are considered to be false.
          Anything else is considered to be true and the wait will be over.
          The function is called with a <code>this</code> of the current job,
          so you can access the entire job's state when determining whether
          or not to return <code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li><b>"new_instruction"</b> Causes a wait_until instruction to be added
    just below this instruction on the do_list. If this is the last instruction
    on the do_list, then this job waits until a new instruction is added on the
    end of a do list.<br/>
    <i>Example</i>:<pre><code title="not in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [Robot.out("first instruction"),
                   Robot.wait_until("new_instruction")]})
Job.my_job.start()</code></pre>
        Evaling <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.start()</code><br/>
        causes "first instruction" to be printed out, then the
        job pauses until an instruction is inserted into the do_list right after this "wait_until" instruction.<pre>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.insert_instruction(Robot.out("the end"),
                       {job: "my_job",
                        offset: "after_program_counter"})</code></pre>
        Causes wait_until to stop waiting, "the end" is printed and the job completes successfully.<br/>
        If instead of that argument to <code>Job.insert_instruction</code>, we had instead used:<pre>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.insert_instruction([Robot.out("the middle"),
                        Robot.wait_until("new_instruction")],
                        {job: "my_job",
                         offset: "after_program_counter"})</code></pre>
        then each time we eval that code, it prints "the middle" and
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job</code> pauses again.
        We can end the pause by inserting an instruction after the program counter
        that doesn't contain a wait_until,
        such as our first call to <code>Job.insert_instruction</code> above.
    </li>
    <li><b>instruction_location</b> <i>Only applies to instruction_locations that
         are arrays or literal objects.</i> Waits for the instruction location
         to refer to a program_counter that is less than or equal to
         the program_counter in the job referenced by the instruction_location.
         This instruction waits until a job gets to a certain instruction.
         This performs like a one_sided <code>Robot.sync_point</code> instruction
         where the job this instruction is in will wait for the job
         specified in the instruction_location, but not the other way around.
         Its advantage over <code>Robot.sync_point</code> is that you don't have
         to have a Robot.sync_point instruction in the job you're waiting for.
         Thus you can wait for a job reaching one of its instructions
         that never expected it to be waited for.<br/>
         Warning: If the instruction_location specifies the job
         that this <code>Robot.wait_until</code> instruction is in, or lets the instruction_location
         default to that, this job could wait for itself and thus forever.</li>

            simulate: true
           })</code></pre>
<p/>
<!--Multiple jobs may use a given robot instance as their robot. It is up to the programmer
to make sure such jobs don't screw each other up. You may not have more than one
active robot with the same name or ip_address.-->
It is recommended that each job have their own robot.
<p/>
The default robot is <code>Robot.dexter0</code>. This is created in your dde_apps/dde_init.js file.
Set dexter0's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> ip_address</code> and
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> port</code> in that file.
We recommend allowing dexter0's simulate param to default to <code>null</code> so that
it can take advantage of the Job menu's Simulate? item.
<p/>
If you are using DDE to control zero or one Dexter, jsut use dexter0. No need
to create your own Robot instance.

<details id="Dexter.draw_dxf_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>draw_dxf</summary>
    This instruction accepts the name of a file as input and creates additional instructions
    to move Dexter to "draw the lines" indicated by the dxf file.
    <ul><li><b>filepath</b> A string representing the name of the dxf file under the <b>dde_apps</b> folder
        containing the dxf instructions. The file can be directly under dde_apps or
        nested in subfolders of any depth.
        <p/>
        The filepath is usually a string that ends in <code>".dxf"</code> or
        <code>".DXF"</code> If it does not and is more than 512 characters long, it
        will be assumed to be a string of actual dxf code.
        </li>
    <li><b>scale</b></li> dxf files indicate line endpoint positions as dimensionless units.
       DDE requires the x,y,z positions to be in microns. <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> scale</code> converts
       the dxf positions to microns. If scale is a number, it multiplies the dxf
       positions by that number. The default for scale is 1, meaning no transformation.
       If the dxf positions are intended to be in millimeters, use 1000 for scale.
       <p/>
       Scale can also be a string representing a scale factor.

<details id="Dexter.empty_instruction_queue_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>empty_instruction_queue</summary>
<i>Parameters:</i> None.<br/>
A Dexter robot has an <i>instruction queue</i> which contains instructions that have been sent from
DDE but not yet executed. As soon as Dexter recieves an instruction from DDE, it typically acknowledges receipt
to DDE,
which causes DDE to send the next instruction in the Job's do_list.
An <code>Dexter.empty_instruction_queue</code> instruction changes that behavior and causes all the instructions in the
queue to be executed before DDE attempts to run another instruction on the do_list.
</details> <!-- end empty_instruction_queue -->

<details id="Dexter.empty_instruction_queue_immediately_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>empty_instruction_queue_immediately</summary>
<i>Parameters:</i> None.<br/>
A Dexter robot has an <i>instruction queue</i> which contains instructions that have been sent from
DDE but not yet executed. As soon as Dexter recieves an instruction from DDE, it typically acknowledges receipt
to DDE,
which causes DDE to send the next instruction in the Job's do_list.
An <code>Dexter.empty_instruction_queue_immediately</code> instruction removes all the
instructions from the instruction queue
without executing them. It then informs DDE to send the next instruction.
This is an unusual instruction as it implies that the instructions sent to Dexter were in error.
You might want to do this in an emergency situation or if the environment unexpectedly changes.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.get_robot_status_queue_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>get_robot_status</summary>
<i>Paramenters:</i> None<br/>
Retrieves lots of information from Dexter. This is placed in an array that becomes the value of
the job's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> robot_status</code> field, and, if the job's
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> keep_history</code> is true, gets pushed onto the
job's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> rs_history</code> array.
<p/>
<i>Examples</i>:
<code>Dexter.get_robot_status()</code>  //how this should look on  job's do list.<br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Jobs.j1.robot_status</code  //getting the whole status array after the above instruction is run><br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Jobs.j1.robot_status[Dexter.J1_ANGLE]</code> //returns the angle of Joint 1, in arcseconds<p/>
This instruction blocks further processing of the job's do_list instructions until
all of the instructions on Dexter's instruction_queue are executed.
<p/>
See also the instruction: <code>Robot.grab_robot_status</code>
</details>

<details id="Dexter.get_robot_status_immediately_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>get_robot_status_immediately</summary>
<i>Paramenters:</i> None<br/>
Retrieves lots of information from Dexter. This is placed in an array that becomes the value of
the job's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> robot_status</code> field, but is not placed on the job's
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> rs_history</code> array.
<p/>
Unlike <code>Dexter.get_robot_status</code>, this instruction causes Dexter to return its data immediately,
before any of the instructions on its <i>instruction queue</i> are executed.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_all_joints_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_all_joints</summary>
move_all_joints is a lower level instruction than move_to, giving you the ability to dicate
the angle of each of Dexter's 5 joints, J1 through J5. A joint's angle is specified in degrees.
The min and max angles of each joint are in constants: <code>Dexter.J1_ANGLE_MIN</code>
through <code>Dexter.J5_ANGLE_MAX</code>, all included in the series <b>Dexter_constant</b>. 
Examples:<br/>
<code>Dexter.move_all_joints(15, null, 30)</code><br/>
<code>Dexter.move_all_joints([15, null, 30])</code><br/>
Both of these have the same function, i.e. you can pass in an array of up to 5 arc_seconds,
or you can pass in individual numbers.
<code>null</code> or the lack of enough numbers means keep the angle for that joint what the
last instruction run in a Job set it to.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_all_joints_relative_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_all_joints_relative</summary>
Similar to <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code> except that the argument of an array of 5 joint angles are
not used absolutely, but added to the previous angles indicated by DDE Dexter motion instructions.
Note that this "base" that is added to is not literally the output of Dexter's optical sensors
for joint position, but rather where the robot was <i>told</i> to go in its last motion instruction
in a Job.
<p/>
A <code>null</code> or missing angle increments default to 0.<br/>
<i>Example</i>:<br/>
<code>Dexter.move_all_joints_relative([15, 15])</code><br/>
tells the Job's robot to move joints 1 and 2 to
an angle that is 15 degrees <i>more</i> than it is currently at.
Joints 3, 4, and 5 stay the same.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_home_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_home</summary>
Moves all joints to 0. J1 is facing forwards, J2, J3, J4 are straight up. J5 
causes Link 5 to be horizontal pointing forwards.
Example: <code>Dexter.move_home()</code>
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_to_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_to</summary>
        This instruction commands Dexter to move from where ever it is, to position its
        end effector at the given x, y, z location. It is complicated by the fact that
        usually there is more than one configuration of Dexter's joints that
        can achieve that position and that Dexter is inherently limited by the
        lengths of its links.
        <i>Parameters</i><br/>
        <b>xyz</b> tells Dexter to position its end effector to a position.
        An array of 3 numbers, each indicating meters from the position 0, 0, 0
        which is at the center of the base of Dexter, in its surface (think table) plane.
        Imagine yourself as Dexter facing forwards. The x-axis is to your left and right
        with left being negative and right being positive. The valid range is
        -0.747804 to 0.747804. The Y axis runs from behind you to in front of you with
        negative behind you and positive in front ranging from -0.747804 to 0.747804.
        The z axis is vertical with below the table being negative and above the
        table ranging from -0.582704 to 0.912904 with 0 being at the table surface.
        Note that not all of the x,y,z combinations are reachable by Dexter.
        If Dexter is on a table, then none of the negative y values are reachable,
        since they are below the table.
        The J5_direction parameter also affects reachability.
        <p/>
        <b>J5_direction</b> indicates the direction you want the end effector to be pointing.
        This is usually an array of 3 numbers (each ranging from -1 to 1)
        that you can think of as indicating a "point" off
        of the end of the end effector. The default is [0, 0, -1] which
        causes the end effector to point straight down.
        <p/>
        J5_direction can alternatively be an array of two angles (in degrees)
        indicating a direction (pitch and yaw). However it cannot be<br/>
        [90, 90], [-90, 90], [90, -90] or [-90, -90]<br/>
        because they represent singularities. If that's the direction you
        want, use an array of 3 numbers.<br/>
        If J5_direction is null, the current direction of the robot (as set by
        the most recent DDE instruction) is used.
        <p/>
        <b>config</b> For most points within the reachability of Dexter, there are multiple
        ways in which Dexter can get there. config helps you specify your preference
        as to <i>how</i> Dexter configures its joints to get to the indicated x, y, z.
        There are 3 independent boolean values to determining this configuration.
        They are: <ul>
            <li><i>base-rotation</i> <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> LEFT</code> means J1, the base joint has a negative value,
                ie it is to the right of facing front. Looking down from the top at Dexter this would
                mean its rotated counter clockwise. The opposite direction is
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> RIGHT</code>
                or clockwise.</li>
            <li><i>J3-position</i> Joint 3 can be thought of as Dexter's elbow. The elbow can be either
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> UP</code> i.e. away from the table or
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> DOWN</code>, closer to the table./li>
            <li><i>J4 Position</i> Joint 4 can be thought of as Dexter's wrist. It can be pointing either
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> IN</code>, towards the base, or
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> OUT</code>, away from the base.</li>
        </ul>
        Config is most easily specified using one of 26 constants such as:
        <code>Dexter.LEFT_DOWN_IN</code> or <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP_OUT</code>. You can omit 1 or 2 of these value as in
        <code>Dexter.LEFT_IN</code> or <code>Dexter.OUT</code>. The complete list is:<br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT</code> => <samp>[0, null, null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_DOWN</code> => <samp>[0, 0,    null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_UP</code> => <samp>[0, 1,    null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_IN</code> => <samp>[0, null, 0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_OUT</code> => <samp>[0, null, 1]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_DOWN_IN</code> => <samp>[0, 0,    0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_DOWN_OUT</code> => <samp>[0, 0,    1]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_UP_IN</code> => <samp>[0, 1,    0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT_UP_OUT</code> => <samp>[0, 1,    1]</samp><br/>
<p/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT</code> => <samp>[1, null, null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_DOWN </code> => <samp>[1, 0,    null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP</code> => <samp>[1, 1,    null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_IN</code> => <samp>[1, null, 0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_OUT </code> => <samp>[1, null, 1]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_DOWN_IN</code> => <samp>[1, 0,    0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_DOWN_OUT</code> => <samp>[1, 0,    1]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP_IN</code> => <samp>[1, 1,    0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP_OUT</code> => <samp>[1, 1,    1]</samp><br/>
<p/>
    <code>Dexter.DOWN</code> => <samp>[null, 0, null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.DOWN_IN</code> => <samp>[null, 0, 0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.DOWN_OUT</code> => <samp>[null, 0, 1]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.UP</code> => <samp>[null, 1, null]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.UP_IN</code> => <samp>[null, 1, 0]</samp><br/>
    <code>Dexter.UP_OUT</code> => <samp>[null, 1, 1]</samp>
<p/>
    <code>Dexter.IN</code>  => <samp>[null, null, 0]</samp>
    <code>Dexter.OUT</code> => <samp>[null, null, 1]</samp>
        The above list is in the series <b>Robot/robot config</b>.
        Not mentioning a boolean (null) means "don't care", ie let DDE figure it out. Since config limits
        the possible options, some configurations will be impossible with some xyz settings and/or
        J5_direction settings. Impossible settings cause an error.<br/>
        If config is null, then the config set by the previous instruction in DDE
        that set config is used.
</details> <!--end move_to -->

<details id="Dexter.move_to_relative_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_to_relative</summary>
    This instruction is similar to <code>Dexter.move_to</code> except that the passed in
    xyz array values (in meters) that are ADDED to Dexter's
    existing end effector xyz values, not taken as absolutes. The other arguments to move_to
    are not passed to this function but rather their previously supplied values are used.<br/>
    <i>Parameter</i><br/>
    <b>delta_xyz</b> Default: <code>[0, 0, 0]</code> The other instructions that move Dexter: Dexter.move_all_joints, Dexter.move_home, Dexter.move_to,
     record the position that they've told Dexter to move to. Then Dexter.move_to_relative
     uses that stored position and "increments" it by the supplied delta_xyz.
     Note this "base" is not exactly the position of Dexter, but rather
     the position that its been told to go by previous instructions.
     <p>
     <i>Example</i>:
<pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [Dexter.move_all_joints(Dexter.NEUTRAL_ANGLES),
                   Dexter.move_to_relative([0.005, 0.01, 0])
                   ]})</code></pre>

</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_to_straight_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_to_straight</summary>
<code>Dexter.move_to_straight</code> is quite similar to <code>Dexter.move_to</code>.
It takes the same first three arguments as move_to and moves Dexter to
the same spot. The difference is the path that Dexter's end effector takes
to getting to the destination. move_to's path is the path that results
from moving all the joints such that they all start moving at the same
time and stop moving at the same time, but each joint may move at
a different speed than the others. In move_to_straignt,
the path approximates a straight line.
<p/>
Dexter achieves this by breaking up the distance between the start
and end xyz locations into many short straight-line segments where
the start and end location of each of these segments is on
a straight line between the starting and ending locations.
<p/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>xyz</b> An array of 3 numbers indicating the x, y, and z location to
           move to. Same as move_to.<br/>
<b>J5_direction</b> The ending direction that LINK5 will be pointing when
    the move is complete. Same as move_to.<br/>
<b>config</b> The configuration of the joints at the end of the move.
    Same as move_to.<br/>
<b>tool_speed</b> The maximum speed that Dexter's end effector will move.
                  Default: 5 millimeters per second. Not in move_to.<br/>
<b>resolution</b> How short to make the straight lines that connect the
starting xyz to the ending xyz. Default: 0.5 millimeters.
<p/>
Example:<br/>
<pre><code title="not in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",
          do_list: [Dexter.move_to([0, 0.55, 0.075]),
                    Dexter.move_to_straight([0, 0.5, 0.075])]
          })</code></pre>
Moves Dexter's end effector from location: [0, 0.55, 0.075] to
location [0, 0.5, 0.075] in a straight line.
</details>

<details id="make_ins_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>make_ins</summary>
Normally you should make instructions for Dexter using one of the high level method calls,
ie <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code>. However, we provide the function <code>make_ins</code>,
useful in some low level situations. The first argument is the instruction type, (nickname: "oplet")
a single letter string such as "a". The remaining arguments are whatever that instruction type
accepts. Example:<br/>
<code>make_ins("a", 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5)</code> =>
<samp>[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, "a", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</samp>
creates an instruction that moves the 5 joints
by 1, through 5 degrees respectively.
If you have the arguments in an array, you can use this syntax:<br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> make_ins("a", ...my_array)</code>
<p/>
The returned value is an array that has its first several fields empty. DDE uses them
for storing the job_id, instruction_id and some timing information.
</details> <!-- end make_ins -->

<details id="Dexter.run_gcode_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>run_gcode</summary>
This instruction accepts the name of a file as input and creates additional instructions 
to move Dexter to "draw the lines" indicated by the gcode file.
<ul><li><b>filepath</b> A string representing the name of the gcode file under the <b>dde_apps</b> folder
    containing the gcode instructions. The file can be directly under dde_apps or
    nested in subfolders of any depth. Typically the filepath will have an extension of ".gcode"
    but that isn't required by filepath.</li>
    <li><b>scale</b></li> gcode files indicate line endpoint positions as dimensionless units.
       DDE requires the x,y,z positions to be in microns. <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> scale</code> converts
       the gcode positions to microns. If scale is a number, it multiplies the gcode
       positions by that number. The default for scale is 1, meaning no transformation.
       If the gcode positions are intended to be in millimeters, use 1000 for scale.

    <i>Example Job Instruction:</i>
    <code>Dexter.set_parameter("J1BoundryHigh", 188)</code>
</details>


<details id="Dexter.sleep_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>sleep</summary>
  Causes Dexter to "go to sleep" for the number of seconds in the one argument.
  When Dexter receives the instruction, it waits for that duration
  before returning control to the DDE job.<br/>
  <i>Example</i>:<code>Dexter.sleep(2)</code><br/>
  Sleeps for 2 seconds.<p/>
  If you effectively want sleep to occur in DDE for any robot,
  you can use a do_list_item of <code>Dexter.wait_until(2)</code>
  to wait for 2 seconds.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Dexter Modes</summary>
Dexter can be put into one of several <i>modes</i> that governs its behavior.
This is done by putting any one of the following Dexter instructions
into a job. When the instruction is run, Dexter will go into that mode.
<p/>
Dexter maintains the last mode it was set to even across jobs, across DDE launches,
and across power cycling Dexter. <p/>
The default mode is <i>set_keep_position</i>.<br/>
None of these instructions take arguments.
    <details id="Dexter.set_follow_me_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>set_follow_me</summary>
        The joints are freed up and the user can drag Dexter's end-effector.
        Dexter's motion instructions (move_to, move_all_joints, etc.) will not work in this mode.
        <p/>
        <i>Example</i>: (as an instruction in a job's do_list.) <br/>
        <code>Dexter.set_follow_me()</code>
    </details>
    <details id="Dexter.set_force_protect_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>set_force_protect</summary>
        Dexter will move to the locations it is told to by instructions.
        But if Dexter is bumped or runs into an object (ie a <i>quick</i> force)
        it will move out of the way.
        However, if a <i>slow</i> force is applied, even if that force is large,
        Dexter will counter that force and attempt to maintain its position.
        <p/>
        <i>Example</i>: (as an instruction in a job's do_list.) <br/>
        <code>Dexter.set_force_protect()</code>
    </details>
    <details id="Dexter.set_keep_position_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>set_keep_position</summary>
        Dexter will move to the locations it is told to by instructions.
        Dexter will actively compensate for any applied forces.
        This mode creates the most accurate joint angles and paths.
        This is the default mode.
        <p/>
        <i>Example</i>: (as an instruction in a job's do_list.) <br/>
        <code>Dexter.set_keep_position()</code>
    </details>
    <details id="Dexter.set_open_loop_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>set_open_loop</summary>
        Dexter will move to the locations it is told to by instructions.
        Dexter will not actively compensate for any applied forces.
        The stepper motors are locked at each desired location but the actually joint angles will have error.
        This mode can be useful for accurately measuring torque.<br/>
        <i>Example</i>: (as an instruction in a job's do_list.)
        <p/>
        <code>Dexter.set_open_loop()</code>

<b>prop</b> A string naming the property who's value will be returned.<br/>
<b>get_from_dexter</b> If <code>true</code>, the value will be retrieved from the
current value of the file //robot.ip_address./share/robot_props.json<br/>
If <code>false</code> (the default):<br/>
If the Dexter instance has the property as an instance property,
its value is returned.<br/>
Else if the property is included in the file
on the dexter robot named //robot.ip_address./share/robot_props.json<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code>"//192.168.1.142/share/robot_props.json"</code><br/>
then a value specific to the robot is returned.
This is used for link lengths (properties LINK1, LINK2 ... LINK5)
because each Dexter has very slightly different link lengths.
Due to Dexter's precision, we must take these lengths into
account when moving the robot to a location.<br/>
Else if the the property is a class property of Dexter
(used for "typical values" or values appropriate for all Dexters),
then that value is returned.<br/>
Otherwise, <code>undefined</code> is returned.
<p/>
You may add a property to a dexter instance like so:<br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Robot.dexter0.my_val = 123</code><br/>
and you can access that via <br/>
<code>Robot.dexter0.my_val</code> or <br/>
<code>Robot.dexter0.prop("my_val")</code><br/>
If you want this value to persist accross DDE launches,

<details id="Human_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Human</summary>
<b>Human</b> is a "robot" that is commanded to do things via pop up dialog boxes.
Examples of its instructions are <code>Human.task</code>, and <code>Human.enter_number</code>.
When a human instruction is run, a dialog box is shown and the job waits for a user to
enter some information and click on a button to either cancel the job (and dependent jobs)
or proceed.
<p/>
Human instructions are a way to encode tasks that Dexter can't do or information
that it can't know. The inclusion of human instructions in DDE permits the design and
running of jobs that need coodination between humans and machines.
<p/>
Although the "home" of human instructions is in the <i>Human</i> robot, you can use
these instructions in a job with <i>any</i> robot. They do not attempt to
access robot hardware.
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Human Instructions</summary>
<details id="Human.task_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>task</summary>
  When run, all human instructions present a dialog box on the screen and waits until the
  user clicks the <button>Done</button> button before allowing the job to proceed to the
  next instruction in its do_list. A <button>Stop this & dependent jobs</button> button is
  also presented. If clicked, this job and its dependent jobs are stopped.<p/>
  <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>task</b> Default: "". A string that will appear in the body of the dialog box. It is intended
     as an English instruction to the human reading it. When the human has completed
     the instruction, they should press <button>Done</button>.
     If the human is unable to complete the task, they should press
     <button>Stop this & dependent jobs</button><p/>
   <b>dependent_job_names</b> Default: []. The names of the jobs that will be stopped if the
       user presses <button>Stop this & dependent jobs</button><br/>
   <b>title</b> Default: the job name and "Human Task". A string shown in the title bar of the dialog.
          To have no title, pass in <code>""</code> .<br/>
   <b>x</b> Default: 200. The number of pixels between the left edge of the dialog and the left edge of the DDE window.<br/>
   <b>y</b> Default: 200. The number of pixels between the top edge of the dialog and the top edge of the DDE window.<br/> 
   <b>width</b> Default: 400. The width of the dialog box in pixels.<br/>
   <b>height</b> Default: 400. The height of the dialog box in pixels.<br/>
   <b>background_color</b> Default: "rgb(238, 238, 238)" i.e. light gray. The background color of the dialog box.
    Each of the numbers for red, green, and blue can be between 0 and 255 inclusive. 0,0,0 is black.<br/>
    <i style="color:rgb(200,0,200);">All of these parameters are common to <b>all</b> human instructions.

<details id="Human.enter_choice_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>enter_choice</summary>
  <code>Human.enter_choice</code> presents a dialog allowing the user to choose one of several supplied options.
  See <b>Human.task</b> for behavior common to all Human instructions.<p/>
  <i>Uncommon Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>choices</b> Default: []. An array of strings. 
      The user is allowed to select one of the given choices.<br/>
  <b>show_choices_as_buttons</b> true or false, default: false. When false, the choices are 
    shown in a menu with the first choice selected.
    When true, each choice has a button and there is no <button>Done</button> button.
  <b>one_button_per_line</b> true or false, default: false. If true, each button
   appears on its own line in a vertical stack. If true, the buttons are positioned
   left to right, taking up more than 1 line only when necessary to display the extra buttons.<br/>
  <b>user_data_variable_name</b> Default: "choice". When the user clicks <button>Done</button>, 
  the selected choice will be made the value of the variable named in this parameter.
  That variable will be in the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> user_data</code> of the current job.
  Within another instruction in the same job, the selected choice will be accessible using
  JavaScript. If the user_data_variable_name is 'my_color' and the choice is 'blue'.
  then <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.users_data.my_color</code will return <code>'blue'</code>.
  You can access this value from <i>another</i> job via:<br/>
  <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> job.some-job-name.user_data.my_color</code>.
  Note that JavaScript from any job can also reset this value. For example:<br/>
  <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> job.some-job-name.user_data.my_color = 'green'</code>.
</details>

<details id="Human.enter_instruction_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>enter_instruction</summary>
  Presents a dialog allowing the user to enter an instruction to be immediately run.
  This can also record instructions and create a job with the recorded do_list.
  See <code>Human.task</code> for behavior common to all Human instructions.<p/>
  This instruction does not use <b>user_data_variable_name</b>.<p/>
  This instruction can only be used on jobs with a Dexter robot.<p/>
  <i>Uncommon Paramaters:</i><br/>
  <b>instruction_type</b> Default: "Dexter.move_all_joints". Set's the dialog's default instruction type.</br/>
  <b>instruction_args</b> Default "5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000".

     If this is more than 1, a user will be able to drag the lower right corner of the text field
     to increase the visible lines.
</details>

<details id="Human.notify_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>notify</summary>
    <code>Human.notify</code> displays information for the user.
  See <b>Human.task</b> for behavior common to all Human instructions,
  but unlike other Human instructions, <b>notify</b> does not have a <b>user_data_variable_name</b> parameter,

</details>
<details id="Human.show_window_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>show_window</summary>
<i>show_window</i> comes in two flavors. The first is as a function that can
be called from any JS code.
It is documented under<br/><a href="#" onclick="open_doc(show_window_doc_id)">
Ref Man/Window System/show_window</a>
<p/>
The second is as a Human robot instruction. It is documented here but
you will need the function-equivalent documentation to understand the show_window instruction.
<samp>Human.show_window</samp> is very similar to  <samp>show_window</samp>,
but intended to be an instruction in a job. When the show_window instruction
is run, a dialog box pops up containing its content, just like the function,
except that it pauses the job that it is in.
Clicking on buttons, etc, calls the callback function, just like the function.
But when a "submit" button is clicked or something else in the
callback function that also closes the window, such as a call to
<code title="unEVALable code fragment.">close_window(vals.window_index)</code>,
here's what happens:
<ol><li>The dialog box is closed.</li>
    <li>The argument to the callback function that contains all the values
        of all the input widgets is bound to the Job's <samp>user_data</samp> variable
        named in user_data_variable_name argument to the instruction.
        These values can be used by subsequent instructions.</li>
    <li>The instruction is finished, and the next instruction in the Job's
        do-list (if any) is run.</li>
</ol>
<p/>
If you just want to get one value at a time from a user, its easier to
use the other Human instructions for number, text, etc. But
if you want to get multiple values in one dialog, using this
instruction is the way to go.
<p/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
The vast majority of the parameters to the show_window instrution are the same
as to the show_window instruction. Here we only document differences.<br/>
<b>callback</b> Very similar to the function-equivalent except that
when it is called, <code title="unEVALable JS fragment">this</code> is bound
to the job that the instruction is in. You can use this to, for instance, stop the job,
by calling (within the callback)
<code title="unEVALable JS fragment">this.stop_for_reason("interrupted", "your explanation.")</code>
<br/>It is common in using this instruction to not have a callback function, since the
real action(s) taken due to the values that the user has input occurs by subsequent
instructions in the job that read those values from the Job's user_data.<br/>
<b>user_data_variable_name</b> Default: <code>"show_window_vals"</code>.
Similar to other Human instructions, this is the place that values from
input elements are stored when the dialog is closed.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list:
           [Human.show_window({content:
`First name: &lt;input type="text" name="first_name"/>&lt;br/>
 Last name:  &lt;input type="text" name="last_name"/>&lt;br/>
 &lt;input type="submit" value="Done"/>`,
                          user_data_variable_name: "my_name"}),
            function(){ out("Hello, " +
                            this.user_data.my_name.first_name + " " +
                            this.user_data.my_name.last_name)}]})
                         </code></pre>
    In this example, we don't care about the callback function.
    The values of the first and last name that the user entered are
    stored in<br/>
    <code title="unEvalable JS fragment">Job.my_job.user_data.my_name.first_name</code> (and last_name)<br/>
    then used by the 2nd instruction to print them out.
    <p/>
    An easy debugging trick, is that you can EVAL the call to <code>show_window</code>
    and see the dialog that will be presented, by running the instruction WITHOUT
    actually running the job. To do this for the above example, select the
    text starting with <code>show_window</code> and continuing only through
    its close paren, excluding the following comma separating it from the
    next instruction. Then click the <button>Eval</button> button.
    <p/>
    Note that when you click on buttons in the resulting dialog,
    <code title="unEVALable JS fragment">this</code> will not be bound to
    the surrounding job, but otherwise the callback should behave the same
    as it does when running the whole job.

<details id="Serial_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Serial</summary>
<b>Serial</b> is not a specific robot per se, its a connection to another computer via its serial port.
This connection is very general. It knows nothing about the actual capabilities of what its
connected to, only that it can send and receive strings on its serial port.
<p/>
DDE's Serial robot is quite similar to Dexter from DDE's perspective. It
can be sent instructions from a Job's do_list and its output is interpreted as
a "robot_status" similarly to Dexter's robot_status. The Serial robot has been
used to connect to Arduino boards via its USB connector, and should work with Raspberry Pi and other
similar devices.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Arduino</summary>
In order for the serial port connection to work with Arduino, you need to have
the Arduino IDE installed. Its a free and easy download from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc">https://www.arduino.cc</a>
<p/>If you don't get a connection, sometimes unplugging and replugging the 
USB cable will help. You can also try relaunching DDE.
Another debugging techinque is using the Arduino IDE's menubar/Tools/Serial Monitor.
The upper type in area is for a string that you want to send to the board.
The lower area displays strings coming back from the board.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Arduino and Mac</summary>
Beware: It appears that Arduino plays poorly with Macintosh computers.
We've been unsuccessful at connecting a Sparkfun RedBoard with Mac and
have heard of other problems between Arduino's Uno R3 boards. We've had success

Create an instance of Serial similar to the other robots. Example: <br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new Serial({name: "S1", ...})</code><p/>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Parameters to new</summary>
<b>name</b> A string. Makes this instance of a Serial Robot accessible from Robot.the_name<br/>

<b>simulate</b> true or false. Default <code>true</code>. If true, no data is sent or recieved over
the actual serial port.<br/>

<b>sim_fun</b> A function. Default <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> return_first_arg</code>.
Used only when <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> simulate: true</code><br/>
When a Serial.string.instruction is simulated, its argument,
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_string</code> is
passed to the sim_fun. The value returned from calling sim_fun is the simulated return value (a string)
from the serial port for this instruction. The function can use any JavaScript to compute
the returned string. <p/>
Consider the item_delimiter when making up this returned string. Often
the string should end in the item_delimiter, but it doesn't have to. <p/>
We're not expecting
the sim_fun to do exactly what the Serial hardware would do. In fact if it could,
there would be no need for the hardware! Rather sim_fun should perform as a diagnostic
for at least one case or perhaps a few cases of instruction strings.
The default value of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> return_first_arg</code> just returns its input to help you verify that
the basic communication path is working.<br/>

<b>path</b> A string. Required. The label for the device connected to a serial port on the computer running DDE 
that you want this software robot to connect to.
Valid paths can be seen
by calling <code>serial_devices()</code>. On Windows, they look something like
 <code>"COM3"</code>.
On Mac, they look something like <code>"/dev/tty.usbmodem1411"</code>. 
 In addition to the tty path, Mac's also have a "cu" path such as: <code>"/dev/cu.usbmodem1411"</code>.
 We've found both <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> tty</code> and
 <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> cu</code> paths to work with DDE.<br/>

<b>connect_options</b> A literal object. Default <code>{}</code>. <br/>
Example: <code>{baudRate: 9600}</code> <br/>
9600 is the default baudRate (which is the same as bitrate, i.e. bits per second). All options documented at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport#serialport-path-options-opencallback">https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport#serialport-path-options-opencallback</a><br/>

<b>capture_n_items</b> A non-negative integer. Default <code>1</code>.<br/>
DDE waits until it has recieved capture_n_items from the device before calling the next instruction on
the job's do_list. The string returned by the serial device is cut up by
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> item_delimiter</code>,
to determine the number of items returned by the serial device.
<br/>

<b>item_delimiter</b> A string. Default <code>"\\n"</code>. Note that Arduino's 
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println("foo")</code> will send out a 5 character string of <code>"foo\\r\\n"</code><br/>

<b>trim_whitespace</b> A boolean. Default <code>true</code>.
If this is true, then an "item" (string) returned by the serial port, will have the
whitespace at its beginning and end removed. Note that with the defaults in place
of an item_delimiter of <code>"\\n"</code>, and trim_whitespace of <code>true</code>,
then when Arduino executes: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println("hi")</code> the actual 4 characters
transmitted to DDE are: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> vhi\\r\\n</code>. It is recognized as one item because
it ends in the delimiter, giving us a 3 character item, except that the
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> vtrim_whitespace</code>
takes off that final <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> v\\r</code> and we're left with
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> hi</code>, usually what you want.
<p/>
This arrangement gets around our society's failure to set one standard for the most important formatting
operation, breaking up of lines, with <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\n</code> being used by Unix and Mac, and
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\r\\n</code> being used by Windows and Arduino. DDE tries to use the more
sensible <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\n</code> where possible. Thus <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\n</code> can be our
default item_delimiter and we still win calling Arduino's
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println</code>.
<br/>

<b>parse_items</b> true or false. Default true. If true, the returned items will be converted from strings to
primitive JS data types: booleans, numbers, arrays, literal objects, strings, and aggrigates of such.
Example: In Arduino C, you could have a program that executes: 
<br/><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println("[1, 20, 300]");</code><br/>
With <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> parse_items: true</code> that would result in DDE's robot_status array as an element of
an array of three integers.

<b>capture_extras</b> One of "error", "ignore" or "capture". Default "error". 
<ul><li><code>"error"</code> means that any extra data output by the board will cause an error, halting the current job.</li>
    <li><code>"capture"</code> means that extra output will be appended onto the end of the robot_status associated
        with the last instruction sent. Beware that such data won't be available as soon as the expected
        data of capture_n_items has been received.</li> 
     <li><code>"ignore"</code> means that any items after capture_n_items and before the next instruction sent will
        be thrown away, but will not cause an error.</li>
</ul>
<b>instruction_callback</b> A function that is called when a valid return value is received
to control what a job should do next. The default causes the next instruction in the Job's
do_list to be executed. Usually you won't want to change this.<br/>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Serial Instructions</summary>
<details id="Serial.string_instruction_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>string_instruction</summary>
Has one argument, a string, which is sent the the Serial robot. 
If the argument is <i>not</i> a string, it is converted to one using <code>JSON.stringify</code> .
The functionality of that string is entirely dependent on how the device
you are sending it to, interprets it.<br/>
Example: <code>Serial.string_instruction(4.5)</code><br/>
sends the 3 character string: <code>"4.5"</code>  to the serial robot.<br/>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Debugging Serial</summary>
Due to the interplay between two different computers (the one running DDE and the Serial device)
and their entirely different software protocols, debugging Serial robot interfaces is challenging.
DDE provides a number of low level functions that can be invoked without interacting with a job
to help you verify connectivity.<p/>

<b id="serial_devices_doc_id"><code>serial_devices()</code></b> Returns an array of objects representing
the available devices on serial ports. the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> comName</code> field holds the path to the serial
port that you can use to connect to that device. 
<p/>

<b id="serial_path_to_info_map_doc_id"><code>serial_path_to_info_map</code></b> Holds the mapping between the
path of a serial device and lots of properties about it, most of which come from defining
the associated Serial robot. The value of this global variable is a JS literal object with
keys of each path to which there is a serial connection, and values of
another JS literal object holding useful properties of that connection, i.e. its "info".<p/>
You can get the info for a path via <br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_path_to_info_map[path]</code>
<p/>

<b id="serial_connect_low_level_doc_id"><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_connect_low_level("/dev/tty.some_device")</code></b>
Allows you to create a software connection between a serial device and DDE software NOT in a job.

<b id="serial_send_low_level_doc_id"><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_send_low_level( "some_path", "some_string")</code></b>
Allows you to send a string to a serial device from DDE but NOT in a job.

<details id="units_system_help_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Units System</summary>
    Throughout DDE, the primary functions and instructions assume SI units for their
    numerical values. Example: length is in meters.
    There are a few exceptions to this rule, but we stick to it for the major functionality.
    Internally, Dexter uses microns for length and arcseconds for degrees,
    but programmers rarely see such numbers.
    <p/>
    However, we recognize that for various reasons, you might want to record numbers
    in some other units. To facilitate that, we provide an easy way to convert
    from other common units into DDE standard units.
    On the DDE menubar/Series/DDE/Units/ you can see the various series for the
    dimensions DDE supports. Pick one to insert it (such as "length" to insert "_km".)
    <code>_km</code> is a global variable bound to a constant number, in this case, 1000.
    To convert a number "my_length" from kilometers to the DDE standard, meters, use
    <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> my_length*_km</code> and that will eval to: my_length * 1000
    which represents my_length in meters instead of kilometers.
    If my_length is 2, and it is meant to refer to 2 kilometers, then
    my_length*_km evals to 2000 and is meant to be in meters.
    You can think of "*_km" as declaring the units that my_length is in.
    <h4>More Examples</h4>
    _unitname is the conversion factor to go from that unitname into the Base Unit for that series.
    For example 1*_rev specifies 1 revolution and because the Base Unit for angles is degrees,
    1*_rev will become 360 and 0.5*_rev will become 180 and so on.
    There is nothing fancy going on behind the scenes, _rev is just a number,
    in this case 360. To go backwards from a base unit to a desired unit simply divide.
    If you were wondering how many revolutions 1 million degrees is eval what's in white below:
    1000000 / _rev
    It works for combination of unit too. For example the Base Unit for speed is meter / second.
    If you are not familiar with how much a m/s is you specify your speed,
     then multiply by _mile / _hour for MPH or _in / _s inches per second.
     These can help with complicated conversions for example:
    <p/>
    I've run a mile in 4:24 what is that in MPH?
    var meter_per_sec = _mile / (4*_min+24*_s)
    var MPH = meter_per_sec / (_mile/_hour)
    <p/>
    Mathematically, the notation _unit is shorthand for base_unit / _unit.
    For example the value of _rev is 360 as in there are 360 degrees per 1 revolution.
    This system only works when the Base Unit is assumed.
    DDE "assumes" the Base Units by have every constant in those units and having every
    function only work with the Base Units.
    The majority of Base Units are SI units with a few exceptions:<br/>
    For angles: DDE uses degree instead of radian.<br/>
    For temperature DDE uses -Celsius instead of Kelvin.
    <p/>
    <h4>Base Units</h4>
    These are the units that DDE uses in its constants and functions.
    These are also the units that the Units System converts to.
    <ul><li>For length: meters</li>
        <li>For angles: degree</li>
        <li>For duration: second</li>
        <li>For weight: kilogram</li>
        <li>For mass: Newton</li>
        <li>For frequency: hertz</li>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Object System</summary>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Overview</summary>
An object system helps you organize data that can inherit from
other objects or classes. Most programming languages have a 
class-instance based object system. JavaScript's new class-based
object system is a mediocre class-instance object system.
But the original JavaScript object system is supposed to
be a "prototype" object system. Good prototype object systems
are simpler, more flexible and easier to learn than
class-instance object systems. However, JS's original object
system isn't a good prototype object system as demonstrated by
the numerous object system varients added on to JS, including
JS 6's class object system. 
<p/>
One of the problems with class-instance object systems is that
they force you to decide whether an object should be a class
or an instance. But sometimes you want to use a particular object
as both a class (to inherit from) and an instance (that
you can set instance variables in). You may also want to
"inhert" from an "instance". One of the most powerful
descriptive mechanisms in natural language is to say
something like "The chair I want is just like this one
except its blue." This is using an instance of a chair
to describe another instance of chair that inherits 
from the first instance. Class-instance object systems
don't allow you to do this, but good prototype object systems
and DDE's object system do.
<p/>
We've coerced JS's prototype object system into
a more useful one by adding some methods to JavaScript.
These new methods, in conjunction with existing JS functions,
give you a pretty good prototype object system.
<p/>
</details> <!-- overview -->

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Calling Methods</summary>
Method calls look very similar to Javscript method calls.
Within the body of a method, you can use <code>this</code> to refer
to the object instance that the method was called with, just like JS.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>New Object System Methods</summary>
DDE augments JS with some new variables, functions and methods to
help you get the most value out of a prototype object system.

<details id="rootObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Root</summary>
<code>Root</code> is a global constant that contains the root object of DDE's object system.
</details>

<details id="newObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>newObject</summary>
<code>newObject</code> let's you create a new object. It takes
literal objects as arguments, usually just one.
The properties of the arguments become the properties
of the new object. If two of the input objects have a same named property,
the property in the resulting object will have the value of the <i>last</i> argument.
There are three properties that behave 
specially.
<p/>
<b><i>prototype</i></b> This property sets the "parent" object
of the new object. <i>prototype</i> defaults to <code>Root</code>.
Once you have the new object, <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new_obj.prototype</code> gives you
back that prototype. Unlike most other properties, you cannot set this property and win.
Class-instance object systems don't allow you to change the class of an object.
In practice, this usually isn't needed.
<p/>
<b><i>name</i></b> This optional property gives the new object a "name"
property (as is normal), but it also creates a field in the prototype
object with the new name and a value of the new object. By doing this,
you have a path from the <code>Root</code> to this new object using the
object names from the top on down separated by dot.
The names immediately under the root object are global so
you can omit <code>Root</code> from such paths.
<p/>
You should only supply a name when calling newObject, and never set it.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<pre><code>newObject({
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "vehicle",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: "white",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight: 3000})</code></pre>
    <code>Root.vehicle</code> => the new object<br/>
    <code>Root.vehicle.name</code> => <samp>"vehicle"</samp><br/>
    <code>Root.vehicle.color</code> => <samp>"white"</samp><br/>
<pre><code>newObject({
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prototype: Root.vehicle,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "boat",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: "blue"})</code></pre>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat</code> => the new object<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.name</code> => <samp>"boat"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.color</code> => <samp>"blue"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.weight</code> => <samp>3000</samp> //inheited from vehicle<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.color</code> => <samp>"white"</samp> // hasn't changed.<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.weight = 2000</code><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.weight</code> => <samp>2000</samp> //inherits the new value from vehicle<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.launch = function(){return "set sail"}</code><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.launch()</code> => <samp>"set sail"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.launch()</code> => <samp>"set sail"</samp>
<p/>
<b><i>constructor</i></b>
When creating an object, (or afterwards) you can set a property named 
<code>constructor</code> in the new object to a method. This method is called
whenever a new object is created with <code>newObject</code>.
Unlike its counterpart in JS6 classes, <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> constructor</code>
is called with no arguments. However, <code>this</code>
is our new object with all the fields populated from the properties
passed in the call to <code>newObject</code>, saving a ton of boiler plate code.
In the body of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> constructor</code>, you can call any code you like,
including code that modifies the passed in property values, create
entirely new properties or remove ones from <code>this</code>.
<p/>
Example: <pre><code>newObject({name: "animal",
 constructor: function(){ this.fur = "no"}})
 newObject({prototype: Root.animal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name: "fido"})</code></pre>
<p/>
Above, during the first call to newObject, <code>this</code> is bound
to the <i>animal</i> object. But when the 2nd call to newObect is
made, the <code>this</code> in animal.constructor is bound to
the object in Root.animal.fido.<br/>
Here's the state of the relevant properties:<br/>

<code>Root.animal.fur</code> => <samp>"no"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.animal.fido.fur</code> => <samp>"no"</samp> <br/>

Each object has its own copy of the "fur" property.
Setting one will not set the other.
<p/>
JS6 class constructor methods can have a call to <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> super</code>.
It's counterpart in DDE is a method whose name makes sense:
<code>callPrototypeConstructor</code>, documented below.
</details>

<details id="callPrototypeConstructor_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>callPrototypeConstructor</summary>
When you have a hierarchy of objects, often you want an object low in the
hierarchy to be initialized similarly to ones higher up, but with
some modifications. Thus you'd have constructor on a "vehicle" object,
then another one on a sub-object, "boat". The boat object should
probably call the constructor for the vehicle object at the top
of the boat constructor, and then make additional modifications to
"this" in the bottom part of the boat constructor method.
<p/>
Example: <br/>
<pre><code>newObject({name: "animal",
           constructor: function(){ this.fur = "no"}})
newObject({prototype: Root.animal, name: "mammal",
  constructor: function(){<br/>
     this.callPrototypeConstructor()<br/>
     this.fur = "usually"<br/>
     this.hair = "sometimes"<br/>
  	 out("in mammal constructor")}})</code></pre><br/>
After running the above code,<br/>

<code>Root.animal.fur</code> => <samp>"no"</samp>.<br/>
<code>Root.animal.mammal.fur</code> => <samp>"usually"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.animal.mammal.hair</code> => <samp>"sometimes"</samp><br/>

You don't <i>have to</i> call callPrototypeConstructor,
and even if you do, it doesn't have to be before
the lower level constructor function modifies <code>this</code>
though <i>usually</i> these are good practices.
</details>

<details id="Object.isNewObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>isNewObject</summary>
Returns true if the argument was created with newObject.
Examples:<br/>
<code>Object.isNewObject({a:11})</code> => <samp>false</samp><br/>
<code>Object.isNewObject(newObject({name: "trash"}))</code> => <samp>true</samp><br/>
</code>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>subObjects</summary>
Returns an array of the named subobjects of <code>this</code><br/>
Example:<br/>
<code>Root.subObjects()</code> => array of the top level named new objects.
</details>

<details id="isSubObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>isSubObject</summary>
The primary relationship between objects in DDE's object system
is the prototype relationship. An object inherits properties from
its prototype. If you want an object to have  a different value
for a particular property than its prototype object does,
ust create a property in the object, and that will effectiely
"shadow" the prototype value and use the "local" value in the object
for that property. 
<p/>
An object always knows which object is its prototype. (All objects
have a prototype except Root.) But prototypes only know
what objects have them as their prototype if those other objects
are named, which is optional. 
By giving an object a name, you automatically install a property
in its prototype with a key of that name and a value of the object.
Now the prototype knows about its "children". We used the term subObject
to mean such named objects.
<p/>
With no argument, 
returns true if <code>this</code> is a named new object and that name is a
property in <code>this.prototype</code> with a value of this.<br/>
In other words: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this == this.prototype[this.name]</code>
Example:<br/>
<code>newObject({prototype: Root, name: "junk"}).isSubObject()</code> => <samp>true</samp>
<p/>
With an argument, the argument is the presumed prototype of this.
If the argument is this's prototype, and the prototype has a field in it named the same as this, 
and its value is this, then isSubObect returns true.<br/>
Example:<br/>
<code>newObject({prototype: Root, name: "junk"}).isSubObject(Root)</code> => <samp>true</samp>
<br/>
</details>

<details id="isA_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>isA</summary>
Returns true if <code>this</code> is the same as or is
an ancestor of the argument.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
    <code>newObject({name: "junk"}).isA(Root)</code> => <samp>true</samp><br/>
        <code>newObject({name: "junk"}).isA(123)</code> => <samp>false</samp>
</code>
</details>

<details id="siblings_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>siblings</summary>
Returns an array of the siblings of <code>this</code>.

</code>
</details>

<details id="Object.lowestCommonAncestor_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>lowestCommonAncestor</summary>
Returns the lowest common ancestor of the arguments. If none, return null.

    <code>Object.lowestCommonAncestor(newObject(), newObject())</code> => <samp>Root</samp>
</code>
</details>

<details id="normal_keys_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>normal_keys</summary>
Returns an array of property names in, or inherited by, <code>this</code>.<br/>
<i>Parameters</i><br/>
<b>passing no args</b> Allowing all 4 args to default to false.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys()</code> => <samp>["color", "weight"]</samp><br/>
<b>include_inherited</b> Property names of all ancestors excluding Root are in the resulting array.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight"]</samp><br/>
<b>include_functions</b> Those properties whose values are functions are included.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight", "launch"]</samp><br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
<b>include_subobject_names</b> The names of the subObjects will be included.
These will be siblings, uncles, great uncles, etc. but not cousins.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true, true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight", "boat", "launch"]</samp><br/>
<b>include_name_and_prototype</b> The keys "'name" and "prototype" will be included.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true, true, true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight"  "name", "prototype"]</samp>
<p/>
Note that you shouldn't depend on the order of the elements in the result array.
If you want to force them into a consistent order, you can sort them alphabetically.
<p/>
The use of "normal" in this method's name indicates that by passing no args,
it gets you what you'll most likely want, and passing in more and more <code>true</code> arguments
gets you more of the less-frequently used properties. (Your milage may vary,
but thats the general idea behind the name.)

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Window System</summary>
    Dealing with HTML, CSS and JavaScript of traditional web apps is complex.
    DDE uses those technologies but with a simplied wrapper for them to help
    users create interactive windows with the most needed features.

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Machine Vision with OpenCV</summary>
        Robots need sensors to understand their environment. A very useful sensor
        is a camera. However, scene recognition is one of the more complex cognitive tasks
        that humans do. Its no different for Robots.
        <p/>
        The most widely used vision software for Robotics is called <i>OpenCV</i>.
        OpenCV is large and complex; necessary characteristics for the task.
        DDE uses a new version of OpenCV called opencv.js, a verison of the
        original C++ program that has been transpiled into JavaScript.
        DDE's opencv.js (as of Aug 30, 2017) corresponds to OpenCV version 3.3.
        That version of OpenCV was released in August 2017.
        opencv.js allows you to use JavaScript calls to access most of the funtionality
        in OpenCV.
        <p/>
        DDE is in the early stages of using opencv.js. There is just one example:<br/>
        Insert menu/show_window/OpenCV<br/> opencv.js functions are available
        from the <code title="unEVALable">cv</code> object, which can be initialized via:<br/>
        <code>var cv = require("opencv.js")</code><br/>
        The first time you do this after launching DDE will take several seconds.
        The rest of the times it is very quick, so no harm in calling it
        more than once.
        <p/>
        <b>Depth Perception</b><br/>
        Many applications in Robotics need 3D scene understanding.
        OpenCV has some tools for processing stereo-pair images for
        sensing depth. It is also possible to mount a single camera on Dexter
        and have it take pictures at different locations to give you a stereo pair.
        <p/>
        Probably using a camera that has build-in depth sensing is the best technique.
        Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html" target="_blank">RealSense</a>
        cameras are a good bet here. There is software to integrate the output of the RealSense cameras
        and OpenCV, though we have yet to experiment with this in DDE.
        <p/>
        <b>Performance</b><br/>
        Computer vision tends to eat up a lot of memory and processor power.
        Modern laptops can keep up for simple tasks, but the faster the machine and the
        more memory you have, the better, especially when processing video.
        <p/>
        <b>OpenCV Help</b><br/>
        Because opencv.js is brand new, most of the documentation you will find
        has examples in C++. opencv.js uses very similar or identical names
        so with a bit of effort, you can make sense of C++ documentation. There
        are also bindings of OpenCV for Python, in case that's easier for you.
        <p/>
        The most definitive guide is
        <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044765.do" target="_blank">Learning OpenCV 3</a>.
        At 1024 pages, this isn't a quick read, but that length is necessary to
        describe the considerable functionality. <a href="http://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV.org</a>
        has tons of useful information.
        <p/>
        Documentation on opencv.js is sparser.
        First, Understand the DDE opencv example.
        Then, you can use DDE's inspector on <code title="unEVALable">cv</code>
        to see available constants and function names. Beware, there are over
        1K properties in this object!
        Next, take a look at: <a href="https://huningxin.github.io/opencv_docs/tutorial_js_root.html" target="_blank">
         opencv.js docs</a>
         <p/>
         <b>Acknowledgement</b><br/>
         opencv.js was created by Sajjad Taheri and his collegues at the University of California, Irvine,
         supported by Intel Corporation. We greatly appreciate this valuable contribution
         to robotics and makers everywhere.

        <details id="show_window_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>show_window</summary>
        A call to <code>show_window</code> creates a dialog box using HTML and JavaScript.
        <i>Parameters</i><br/>
        <b>title</b> A string of the HTML displayed in the window's title bar. Default: "DDE Information"<br/>
        <b>width</b> The number of pixels wide that the window will be. Default: 400.
                     Minimum 100: Maximum: window.outerWidth<br/>
        <b>height</b> The number of pixels tall that the window will be. Default: 400.
                      Minimum: 50, Maximum: window.outerHeight<br/>
        <b>x</b> The number of pixels that the left edge of the window will be from the left edge of the DDE window.
        Default: 200 . Minimum: 0 positions window at left of DDE window.<br/>
        <b>y</b> The number of pixels that the top edge of the window will be from the top edge of the DDE window.
        Default: 200. Minimum: 0 positions window at top of the DDE window.<br/>
        <b>content</b> HTML to be rendered in the body of the window. input tags with
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> type</code>
        attributes of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> button</code> and
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> submit</code> will cause the window's
        callback function to be called.
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> submit</code> will also cause the window to be closed.<p/>
        HTML elements with a class of "clickable" will behave as a button. Clicking on them
        will cause the window's callback button to be called with a
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> clicked_button_value</code>
        property of the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> name</code>, or if none, the
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> id</code> of the clicked on element.
        Clicking on such HTML elements will <i>not</i> close the window.<br/>
        <i>Examples</i>:<br/>
        <pre><code>show_window({
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;content:'&lt;p id="p_id" class="clickable">some para&lt;/p>',
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callback: function (vals){ append_in_ui("p_id", "&lt;h1>hey&lt;/h1>")}
            })</code></pre>
        <b>callback</b> A function of one argument. Any returned valued will be ignored.
        It will be called when the user clicks a button in
        a show_window. It's argument will be a literal object. Many of its properties are x and y positions
        relative to the top-left of html elements in or containing the clicked position.
        <p/>
        Others of its properties will be names and the corresponding values of input elements
        designated in the <i>content</i> argument. The actual "name" used for such an element
        is: <br/>If the element has a "name" properties, use the value of that.<br/>
        else if the element has a "id" property, use that. Note that "id" properties
        become global variables bound to the element, which can be useful
        if you want to programatically change them.<br/>
        else if the element has a "value" property, use that. Note that an
        "input" element of type "button" will have its displayed label be
        the value of its "value" property.
        <p/>
        <i>Example </i> of an argument passed to the callback function:<br/><pre>
    <code>{x: 300,           //relative to the parent of the elt clicked on

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>SVG</summary>
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a way
        to draw 2D graphics on a web page. The drawn elements
        (circles, lines, etc.) are surrounded by a svg tag wrapper
        indicating the size of the drawing area. You can use
        svg tags directly in the content for a show_window.<p/>
        The methods documented below create that html from JavaScript calls,
        facilitating dynamic content creation as well as
        making static svg shapes a little easier to create.<p/>
        <i>Parameters for all svg functions</i>:<br/>
        <b>id</b> The html id of the element, useful in calls to window utility functions
        such as <code>append_in_ui</code>.<br/>
        <b>html_class</b>: Used to set the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code> attrbute of the element.
        Due to a name conflict with <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code> in JavaScript, we had to name this
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> html_class</code>.<br/>
        <b>style</b>: A string setting the css style of the element. Note that some
        arguments to svg functions are actually rendered as style attributes, such as
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> color</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> border_color</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> border_width</code>.

        <details id="svg_svg_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>svg_svg</summary>
            svg shapes must be drawn as child elements of an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> svg</code> element.
            The x and y of those child elements is relative to the upper left corner of
            the containing svg element. So for instance, if you draw a circle with
            x: 0, y: 0, you will see only the lower right corner of the circle
            in the upper left corner of the svg area.
            <i>Parameters</i> <br/>
            <b>width</b>:  Width  in pixels of the rectangle area to put svg shapes in.<br/>
            <b>height</b>: Height in pixels of the rectangle area to put svg shapes in.<br/>
            <b>viewBox</b>: A string of four space_separated numbers that controls the scale and positioning
            of the contained svg elements.<br/>
            <b>child_elements</b>: Default: <code>[]</code>. An array of strings of the html for
            svg shapes. Usually these strings should be created with the svg shape creator functions
            such as <code>svg_circle</code>. <p/>
            <i>Example</i>:<pre><code title="not in TestSuite"> show_window({
   content:svg_svg({
       id:"s_id", width:500, height:200,
       html_class:"clickable",
       child_elements: [
           svg_rect({x:100, y:100,

            <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code>
            and <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> style</code> arguments. If you desire these, they must be placed on the individual
            html tags within the value of the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> html</code> argument. Note that
            here we need to spell the class attribute by its correct HTML name,
            <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code>,
            not the special spelling used in the other svg functions of
            <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> html_class</code>.
