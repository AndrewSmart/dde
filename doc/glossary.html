<h2>Dexter Glossary</h2>
The most useful terms for the Dexter platform.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>kinemetics</summary>
The relationship between the joint angles and the position
of a robot. Forward kinematics is the computation for tranforming
joint angles into end effector location (in Cartesian coorinates).
Inverse kinematics is the computation for tranforming Cartesian
coordinates of an end effector into joint angles. These
computations are complex, especially for Robots with
5 or more axes.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Automatic Tool Changer (ATC)</summary>
A "Hand" that mounts on the end of Dexter's last link that
can grab any end-effector that has a cooresponding ATC handle.
This enables Dexter to easily grab many different end-effectors.
Dexter's ATC can pass both electrical signals and power
to an end-effector, and recieve electrical signals from
sensors in an end-effector.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>arcsecond</summary>
A unit of angle, meaning one 3600th of a degree.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>end-effector</summary>
A tool held by Dexter for performing a specific function such as
a gripper for holding things or a laser for cutting things.
See ATC.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>J5_direction</summary>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>micron</summary>
A unit of length, meaning one milionth of a meter.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>position</summary>
A 3 x 3 matrix holding ???
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>SI Units</summary>
The International scientific units standard.
Generally, Dexter uses these except for angles
instead of the SI radians, we use degrees. DDE has
a easy way to convert numbers between different units.
