    DDE helps you create, debug, and send software to a Dexter robot.
    You can use any Javascript augmented with DDE-specific functions to help find out about,
    and manipulate, a robot.<br/>

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Why Use DDE?</summary>
    Dexter has a limitless variety of capabilities.
    We couldn't think of them all let alone program them.
    And if we could, finding the right button for each program would be
    extremely difficult, besides overfilling screen real estate.
    <br/><br/>
    By providing a general purpose language that is broad enough to cover all the bases,
    yet detailed enough to specify the action details, users can specify the
    precise behavior they desire.
    We've extended JavaScript, most common web page programming language,
    with dexter-specific functions like
    "move" and ways to gets values from its sensors (like camera").
    This allows you to specify things like:
    <i>If part X is in the workspace, then move it 10 millimeters to its left</i>.
    <br/><br/>
    You need a general purpose language to customize that "10"
    with any computable number in a myriad of ways. We may want to
    create actions that depend on conditions that differ with the environment, time,
    or materials. Instead of move, we might want to rotate, or grasp, or drill, etc.
    <details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Won't a Text Editor Do?</summary>
        You could use any old text editor to write code. But you'd need to know:
        <ol>
            <li>What capabilities are available?</li>
            <li>What do they actually do? (semantic details)</li>
            <li>How do I use them? (syntactic details)</li>
            <li>How do I run the code?</li>
            <li>How do I localize bugs?</li>
            <li>How do I understand and fix them?</li>
            <li>How do I store and re-run programs I've created?</li>
            <li>How do I change and extend existing code?</li>
        </ol>
        DDE helps you with all of the above.
    </details>
</details>
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Prerequisites</summary>
    You'll need a Dexter robot and a basic knowledge of JavaScript to make full use of DDE.
    DDE provides a lot of help for learning JavaScript directly and the
    <b>Learning JavaScript</b> section of this documentation gives you a number of
    very good on-line sources to smooth your path.
    Without a robot, you can still use DDE to <i>simulate</i> one.
</details>
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Installation</summary>
    <details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>First Install</summary>
        To get the latest DDE release,
        <ul><li> Browse <a href="https://github.com/cfry/dde/releases/latest" target="_blink">Github</a></li>
            <li> Click on the file for your operating system:
                <ul><li>For Windows: <code>.exe</code></li>
                    <li>For Mac: <code>.dmg</code></li>
                    <li>For Linux: <code>.AppImage</code> </li>
                </ul></li>
            <li> The clicked file will be copied to your downloads folder.
                For Windows and Mac, you may have to click on it to
                complete installation, or that might start automatically.
                For Linux, you will have to make the file executable like so:<br/>
                <code>$ chmod +x dexter_dev_env.AppImage</code><br/>
                in order to run it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>
    <details id="update_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Updating to the latest DDE</summary>
        Follow the directions under <b>First Install</b> above.
        This will not change any files in your <code>dde_apps</code> folder.
        <p/>
        Twist down the <b>About</b> row in the Doc pane to see the installed version number of DDE.
    </details>
    <details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Launch DDE</summary>
        On Windows, the DDE application is installed in
        <code>C:\Program Files\dexter_dev_env\dexter_dev_env.exe</code>
        and on the desktop.<br/>
        On Mac, <code>Macintosh HD/Applications/dever_dev_env.app</code>
        <p/>
        Double click on the file to launch DDE. If there is a file
        <code>Documents/dde_apps/dde_init.js</code>, it will be
        loaded automatically. Thus you can put any code in that file
        that you want to be evaled at start-up, such as libraries you've
        written, etc.
    </details>
</details>
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Configuration</summary>
    DDE requires that you create a folder under your Documents folder named <code>dde_apps</code>.
    If this does not exist when you launch DDE, you'll see a warning in the output pane.
    <p/>
    DDE requires that you define a default robot named "dexter0". Usually the one
    that is automatically inserted into the file dde_apps/dde_init.js is fine.
    However, in that file you will need to set the ip_address and port number
    of Dexter. {todo: document how to find Dexter's ip_address.} The port number
    is typically <code>"50000"</code>.
    <p/>
    When you plug in and power on Dexter, you will see LEDs light up on Dexter's processor board.

    <details id="javascript_pane_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>JavaScript Pane</summary>
        The JavaScript pane is a text editor. You can view and edit any text documents in it,
        but primarily you will be editing JavaScript that defines a job to make something
        with Dexter. DDE expects you to save such "apps" in your <code>Documents/dde_apps/</code>
        folder.
    </details>
    <details id="output_pane_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Output Pane</summary>
        DDE prints information in the Output pane that will be useful in your current context.
        You can explicitly print in the output pane with a call to the JavaScript function <code>out</code>.
        Example:<br/>
        <code>out("hi <i>world</i>", "blue")</code><br/>
        <code>out</code> accepts any valid HTML as its first argument. It will be rendered in the Output pane.
        <details id="start_job_help_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Start Job Button</summary>
            Clicking this button evals and starts the job that the cursor is in.
            <p/>
            If the cursor is in a job's source code but not in the do_list,
            then the job source will be evaled, and the job started.
            <p/>
            If the cursor is on an instruction in the do_list with no selection,
            the job will be evaled and started with the first instruction run being
            the one the cursor is on.
            <p/>
            If there is a selection within the do_list, then the first instruction
            run will be the one that contains the start of the selection,
            and the last instruction run will be the one that contains the
            end of the selection. This works by setting the job's <code>program_counter</code>
            and <code>ending_program_counter</code> properties.
            <p/>
            If you have selected the source code for one or more instructions
            (with comma's between them) and there is no <code>new Job</code> wrapper
            around the instructions, then a Job wrapper will be automatically made
            behind the scenes, the job will be defined, and started.
            <p/>
            Just before an instruction is run, it will be selected in the editor.

    <details id="documentation_pane_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Documentation Pane</summary>
        The Documentation pane attempts to describe the core knowledge you'll need to command Dexter to make things.
        Admittedly we'll always fall short of this goal, but let us know if some crucial information
        is missing and we'll do our best to fill the void.<p/>
        You can find out what version of DDE is running and the latest changes under the
        <b>Release Notes</b> section of the documentation.
        Details about programming Dexter are in the <b>Reference Manual</b> section.
    </details>
    <details id="simulate_pane_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Simulate Pane</summary>
        <div style="padding-left:20px">
            The simulate pane shows a graphical simulation of Dexter with
            joint angles of the last heartbeat robot status returned.
            (By default, heartbeats happen every 100ms.)
            <p/>
            Use the mouse in the <i>Simulate</i> pane to:
            <ul style="padding:0px;margin-left:20px;display:inline-block;" >

        <details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Stepping Instructions</summary>
            To understand a Job's behavior, its useful to <i>step</i> through each instruction.
            Checking the <b>pause</b> checkbox will cause running jobs to pause
            when they have completed their current instruction. Jobs started when
            the pause button is checked will pause right before the first user instruction
            on the do_list is run.<p/>
            When a job is paused, clicking the <button>Go</button> button will cause
            it to execute the next instruction, print out useful information in the Output
            pane, and pause. If a job is paused, and you uncheck the pause checkbox,
            then click the <button>Go</button> button, the job will begin running normally.
            <p/>
            <details id="debugger_doc_id" style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>"debugger"</summary>
                The instruction of <code>"debugger"</code> in a do_list will cause
                the <b>pause</b> checkbox to be checked and the job to pause.
                A function that returns the string <code>"debugger"</code> or
                even an array that has an element of <code>"debugger"</code>
                will cause a pause.
                <p/>
                Note that using the string <code>"debugger"</code>
                is intentionally similar to using the JavaScript constant <code>debugger</code>.
                If you have the constant <code>debugger</code>
                in the body of a function that is a do_list item, or is called by
                a do_list item, it will cause a JavaScript breakpoint and you
                can step through that code using the Chrome dev tools.

    DDE let's you control a Dexter robot with Javascript. You can execute all of JS.
    DDE extends JavaScript with a library of functions that control Dexter, allow access to Unix commands
    on Dexter's computer, Window system extensions, as well as ROS specific function calls allowing you to find out about
    and control Dexter.<p/>
    In DDE, <code>console.log</code> sends its output
    to the (usually hidden) Chrome console.
    Use <code>out</code> (on the <button>Insert&#9660;</button> menu) to see output in the Output pane.
</details>
<details style="margin-left:20px;" id="learning_js_doc_id"><summary>Learning JavaScript</summary>
    The quickest way to learn most of the JavaScript you'll need is from the
    JavaScript Pane's <button>Learn JS&#9660;</button> menu.
    Read menu item tooltips, choose an item to insert code, then click <button>Eval</button>
    to eval all the code in the Editor. If there's a selection when you click Eval,
    just the selected code will be evaluated.
    Choose menu items under  <button>Learn JS&#9660;</button> in depth-first order for a consistent overview, and later you can choose
    exactly those items you need to insert a code snippet.<br/>
    <fieldset><legend><span style="color:red;">Warning</span></legend>

    <details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>JS for Programmers</summary>
        If you're already a competent programmer but don't know JS specifics,
        here's a few tips:<br/>
        JavaScript is an <b>untyped</b> language. That means you don't declare types
        of variables, function parameters, or return values. So for instance,
        <br/>C's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>int foo = 32;</code> <br/>
        in Js is <code>var foo = 32;</code><br/>
        The type system is,
        um, weak. The <b>object system</b> is also in somewhat of disarray. Because of that
        there are many packages adding a more rational Object system, but they all
        differ, confusingly.
        <p/>
        There's no <b>compiler</b> in JavaScript. There are no "includes" or
        "pre processors" or "macros". The code is run in an iterpreter inside
        a browser (every browser, actually). The major browsers also offer a
        debugging environment, though typically no Editor. DDE gives you an editor
        and a lot of other convenieces for developing code.
        <p/>
        <b>Whitespace</b> characters are those characers that "take up space" but you can't
        otherwise see. This includes space, tab, newline and a few others. In Javascript,
        mostly its the case that 1 whitespace character is equivalent to any number of
        contiguous whitespace characters. Except that function calls need to be ended
        with either a semicolon or a newline, not just a space.
        For example:<br/>
        <code>Math.min(3, 4); Math.min(5, 6)</code><br/>
        is legal, as is:<br/>
        <code>Math.min(3, 4)<br/>
            Math.min(5, 6)</code><br/>
        but not:<br/>
        <code>Math.min(3, 4)  &nbsp;Math.min(5, 6)</code>
        <p/>
        There is no <b>Window System</b> per se in JavaScript but it ties into
        HTML, CSS and the browser's Document Object Model. This is confusing since
        it requires several different syntaxes and ways-of-thinking. DDE
        simplifies this by providing
        the key window system facilites you'll need for commanding Dexter
        via the function <code>show_window</code>, the <code>Human.enter_*</code> instructions
        and a few other utilities. See the <button>Insert&#9660;</button> menu.
        <p/>
        Javascript's functionality greatly expanded in 2016 with a new version who's name
        itself is confusing. You'll see <b>EcmaScript 6</b>, JavaScript 2015 and a few variants.
        Browsers vary as to how much of this they implement, but Chrome, the browser
        DDE uses, has nearly 100% of this new standard implemented as of June, 2016.
        DDE depends on these new features.
        <p/>
        See in, this documentation, <b>Installation/Keep Chrome up to date</b>.
        JS 6 can run code from earlier versions of JS, but there's an awful lot
        of new functionality that isn't in most existing JS documentation.
        <p/>
        Like all popular programming languages, JavaScript has its problems.
        But its unique in its "deployability". JS and DDE runs on Windows, Macs,
        Linux, and Chromebooks. Its new features are quite powerful, and DDE strives
        to make learning and using JS as simple as possible. Your new skills will
        serve you well in Web programming for billions of users.

    Eventually you will need to know the concepts of ROS (the Robot Operating System), though
    not the syntax of BASH, C++ and Python normally required to work with ROS.
</details>
<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Workflow</summary>
    DDE let's you execute arbitrary JavaScript that is entered into the JavaScript pane.
    <ol><li>The JavaScript pane's menus allow you to insert useful code snippets into
        the JavaScript pane.</li>
        <li>You can edit and extend the inserted code. Use any valid JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Click the <button>Eval</button> button. The result of the last expression evaluated
            will appear in the Output pane.</li>
        <li>If there is a selection when the <button>Eval</button> button is clicked, only the selected
            code will be executed.</li>
        <li>Triple click on a line to select it.</li>
        <li>Alt-click on a JS function call to select it.</li>
    </ol>
    Try this: type into the editor<br/>
    <code>2 + 3</code><br/>
    Click <button>Eval</button> and see <b>5</b> in the Output pane.

    <details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Persistent Data</summary>
        When you have defined a named function, set a global variable or a property
        reachable by a global variable, that data will remain in the JS environment until
        you relaunch DDE. This is even true if you bring a new file into the editor.
        <p/>
        Overall this facilitates programming, but it does have some behavior that may be unexpected.
        Imagine you define
        <br/><code>function foo(){return bar()}</code> and
        <br/><code>function bar(){return 'stuff'}</code>
        <br/>You call <code>foo()</code> and it returns <code>'stuff'</code>.
        Now you rename <code>bar</code> to <code>baz</code> and test <code>baz()</code>. It returns
        <code>'stuff'</code> as expected, as does calling <code>foo()</code>. Now
        <ul><li>Save this code in a file</li>
            <li>Relaunch DDE</li>
            <li>Open the file in the editor</li>
            <li>Eval it</li>
            <li>Call <code>foo()</code></li>
        </ul>
        The call to <code>foo</code> will error because <code>bar</code> is no longer defined.
        When redefining function and global variables, its a good idea to save your
        code in file(s), relaunch DDE, and reload your code periodically, to check against such issues.

<details style="margin-left:20px;" id='series_doc_id'><summary>Series</summary>
    A useful way to organize knowledge is to construct lists of similar-typed concepts.
    DDE calls such lists <b><i>series</i></b>. There are over 30 series in DDE, including
    numbers, dates, colors, functions for math, strings, arrays, etc.
    The most useful functions and data structures in DDE are in a series.
    <p/>
    The <button>Series&#9660;</button> menu allows you to insert into the
    editor, an example item from each series. When you click on a series item in the editor,
    help is given on that item in the Output pane. Using the Right and Left arrow
    keys, you can replace a selected series item with the next or previous item
    in its series. The Up and Down arrow buttons replace a selected series item
    with an item from <i>another</i> series. Effectively this uses the series of series.
    <p/>
    An example of a series is <code>boolean</code>. Choose it from the <button>Series&#9660;</button>
    menu. It inserts <code>true</code>. Now hit the right arrow key to see additional items
    in the series (false, null, etc.) The left arrow goes backwards through the series.

    With any series item selected, hit the down arrow. If you're on a member of the boolean series,
    this will replace the selection with an item from the <code>integer</code> series.
    Press the up and down arrows to go to a new series.

<details style="margin-left:20px;"><summary>Jobs</summary>
    A job feeds the instructions in its do_list to a robot for making things.
    Most users of DDE will spend most of their time creating and running jobs.
    <p/>
    The <button>Series&#9660;</button> menu gives help on Jobs and Robots.
    <br/>
    The <button>Jobs&#9660;</button> menu contains numerous examples of defining Jobs and
    how to run them. Choose <b>Insert example 1</b> and read the comments to understand Job syntax.
    See the <b>Reference Manual</b> on <b>Job</b> for the details of specifying a job.

<details style="margin-left:20px;" id='robots_doc_id'><summary>Robots</summary>
    A robot is a machine capable of performing the instructions in its instruction set.
    The class hierarchy of DDE Robots is:<br/>
    <ul><li>Robot
        <ul><li>Brain</li>
            <li>Dexter</li>
            <li>Human</li>
            <li>Serial</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    To get a robot to perform instructions, you create an instance of its class, giving it
    at least a name (and in the case of Dexter, an ip_address and a port number) then
    create an instance of Job and give it a robot property of the robot you created.
    The job should also have a do_list, which is the sequence of instructions to run
    on the robot. When the <code>start</code> method is called on a Job, it sends the items
    on its do_list to the associated robot, sequentially, one at a time.
    <p/>
    From a software standpoint, a robot <i>is</i> its instruction set.
    The key difference between different kinds of Robots is the difference
    between their instruction sets. If a robot is sent
    an instruction not in its instruction set, it will error, because it doesn't know
    how to perform that kind of instruction.
    <p>
        <b>Robot</b> is the superclass of all robot classes. It contains instructions that
        can run on all robots. These are <i>control</i> instructions because they help
        manage the flow of instructions in a job. Examples include: <code>Robot.stop</code>
        to end a job immediately without processing the insructions after the stop instruction,
        and <code>Robot.wait_until</code> which pauses execution of the job's instructions until
        the calling of the given JS function returns true.
    <p/>
    See <button>Series&#9660;</button> submenu "robot" for details about robots as
    well as the <b>Reference Manual</b> section on Robots.

<details style="margin-left:20px;" id='TestSuite_doc_id'><summary>TestSuite</summary>
    DDE has the capability to compose, run and report on Test Suites.
    DDE comes with several Test Suites and you can define more.
    <p/>
    Each Test Suite has a name and an array of <i>tests</i>.
    A <i>test</i> is composed of an array of 1, 2, or 3 literal strings.
    <ol><li>A literal string of JavaScript code to evaluate that returns a value to be tested.</li>
        <li>The expected value of the above JavaScript code, also represented by
            a literal string of JavaScript.</li>
        <li>A literal string of a comment to aid in understanding the purpose or behavior of this test.
            If the comment starts with "known", then if the test does not pass, it
            will be reported on as an "known" failure. Other failures will be
            reported as "unknown". Often it is convenient to mark a test as "known" when
            you'd like to defer fixing it and just want to see the "unknown" failures.</li>
    </ol>
    Choose <button>Test&#9660;</button> <b>Insert Example</b> to see a demonstation
    Test Suite. <p/>
    You run a Test Suite by selecting it and hitting the right arrow key or
    choosing the JavaScript pane's <b>Test/naviation/Run & sel next item</b> menu item.
    Use the down arrow key to select the next level down item such as a test or
    even a part of a test. In each case, the right arrow executes the item and
    selects the next item at that level.
    <p/>
    To create a Test Suite, type in the JavaScript source of the suite's first test,
    select it, and choose <button>Test&#9660;</button> <b>Selection to test</b>.
    This will wrap a Test Suite around the item and fill in the test's expected value
    with the result of evaluating the code you have selected. If you do that again
    for a second JavaScript selection, it will also create a test, but this time,
    because the test is <i>already</i> in a Test Suite, it will not create a new
    Test Suite.
    <p/>
    Other operations on the <button>Test&#9660;</button> menu are documented with tooltips.

<details style="margin-left:20px;" id='debugging_id'><summary>Debugging</summary>
    Most programmers spend most of their time debugging.
    We recommend entering just a bit of code at a time; a line or less before testing it.
    That way, when a bug shows up, you'll know it was in the last bit that you added.
    If you fail to do this, and have a large amount of code that has a bug, comment out
    lines incrementally and test to isolate the bug.
    <p/>DDE uses an automatic syntax checker named <i>ESLint</i>. It
    indicates syntax errors in the JavaScript pane as soon as you enter them.
    There are many different styles of JS coding and different versions
    of JS so its hard to get such errors correct. Even if you have syntax
    errors indicated, your code may run fine. As a first pass though, try
    to fix such errors before evaling. If you can't, go ahead and evaluate
    your code. Perhaps runtime errors will help you fix the bug,
    or perhaps it will run OK and you'll know to just ignore the JS Pane syntax
    bug indication.
    <br/><br/>
    Evaling just selected portions is another way to isolate bugs. If there is a selection
    of JavaScript code, only that code will be evaled when you click <button>Eval</button>
    <br/><br/>
    Another technique is to comment out code until your bug goes away.<br/>
    <b><code>// </code></b> comments out to the end of the line.<br/>
    <b><code>/* comment */</code></b> Wrap JavaScript in <br/>
    slash-star ... star-slash<br/> to comment
    out code in the middle of a line or multiple lines.
    See the JavaScript pane's <button>Learn JS&#9660;</button> <i>debugging</i> menu items.
    <br/><br/>
    Entering <code>debugger;</code> into the body of a JS function definition will set a breakpoint there.
    When <code>debugger;</code> is evaluated (after you call the function) and the <i>Chrome Developer Tools</i>
    window is open, execution will pause and highlight the <code>debugger;"</code> statement in a copy
    of your source code.
    (To open the <i>Chrome Developer Tools</i> window, click right on any DDE pane and choose
    <b>Inspect</b>. If you don't see "Inspect" on the menu, read the documentation
    under "Installation" on "Configure Chrome".)
    Use the arrow buttons <img src="stepper_buttons.png" width="120" alt="stepper buttons"/>
    in the Developer Tools window upper right to step execution.
    <br/><br/>
    Wrapping <code>console.log(...)</code> around a complex data structure will print it
    out in the Chrome Developer Tools console with arrows to allow you to expand
    data pieces of your choice to inspect. To see the console,
    click right anywhere in DDE and choose "Inspect".<p/>
    You can print strings into the Output pane with a call to <code>out</code>.
    Because <b>out</b> returns
    its 1st argument, you can embed it in code to see an intermediate value.<br/>
    <code> (out(2 + 3)) * 4</code> <br/>will print out 5, but return 20.<br/>
    <button>Insert&#9660;</button> <i>Print to output</i> has items that print in a few different colors
    so that you can distinquish some outputs from others in a complex debugging session.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>speak</b> behaves similarly to <b>out</b> in that it returns its 1st arg.
    It can be useful in contexts where you want to know a value but don't
    want to look at the screen to find it.
    speak is on the Insert menu, under <i>Learn Javascript/debugging</i>.
